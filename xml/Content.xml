			<p>Bean was created at the 2019 election after the Australian Capital Territory's seat entitlement increased from two to three, supplementing the existing safe Labor seats of Canberra and Fenner. The arrangement is similar to that which prevailed when the territory briefly had a third seat between 1996 and 1998, when the short-lived electorate at the southern end took the name of Namadgi. David Smith comfortably won Bean for Labor in 2019 in the face of a slight two-party swing to the Liberals, with independent Jamie Christie taking a bite out of both major parties' primary votes to poll 8.3%.</p>

			<p>Bean covers the southern end of Canberra, along with the unpopulated areas of the Australian Capital Territory outside of the city. Nomenclature aside, Canberra might more properly have been considered the &#8220;new&#8221; electorate in 2019, since Bean drew its entire territory from Canberra as previously constituted, whereas Canberra gained the city centre and its surrounds from Fenner. In moving from two seats to three, the territory went from having around 140,000 voters per electorate to around 100,000, compared with a national average of around 110,000.</p>

			<p>Labor member <b>David Smith</b> is a former director of the Professionals Australia union and member of the Right faction. He first entered parliament in May 2018 as a Senator, having filled the vacancy caused by Katy Gallagher's disqualification under Section 44. Smith had been the second candidate on the Labor ticket at the 2016 election, and was thus elected in the recount ordered by the High Court.</p>
			<p>Smith's parliamentary career appeared at first to be a short-term proposition, since Gallagher was assured of a comeback at the 2019 election, and he lacked support for the territory's newly created third House of Representatives seat. However, his fortunes turned with the retirement of Gai Brodtmann, who had appeared set to move from Canberra to Bean, and he was duly able to win preselection for the new seat.</p>

			<p>Held safely for Labor by first-term member Alicia Payne, Canberra encompasses the capital's city centre, parliamentary district and surrounding suburbs. It was substantially altered when the Australian Capital Territory gained a third seat at the 2019 election, absorbing the city centre and inner northern suburbs from Fenner, whereas the ostensibly new seat of Bean took the entirety of its enrolment from the old Canberra.</p>
			<p>The Canberra electorate has existed in name since a single Australian Capital Territory electorate was divided into Canberra and Fraser in 1974, with Fraser's name changing to Fenner in 2016. This arrangement was interrupted when the territory briefly acquired a third seat between 1996 and 1998, resulting in boundaries broadly similar to the new ones, with the southern seat taking the name of Namadgi rather than Bean. The territory had no parliamentary representation before 1949, and its member had voting rights only in relation to local matters until 1968.</p>
			<p>Labor's dominance of the territory has been disturbed only on rare occasions: when independent Lewis Nott was elected upon the inauguration of the Australian Capital Territory electorate in 1949; when the Liberals won Canberra in the twin landslides of 1975 and 1977; and with Labor's defeat in the Canberra by-election of March 1995. Whitlam government Attorney-General Kep Enderby held Canberra from 1974 until his defeat in 1975, having previously been the member for Australian Capital Territory.</p>
			<p>The member from 1980 to 1995 was Ros Kelly, a Hawke-Keating government minister who fell victim in 1994 to the still notorious &#8220;sports rorts&#8221; affair. Her indulgent departure from politics a year later was followed by a bruising by-election loss, in which Brendan Smyth gained the seat for the Liberals on a 16.2% swing. Smyth ran unsuccessfully in Namadgi in 1996, and later served in the ACT parliament from 1998 to 2016.</p>
			<p>Canberra was recovered for Labor in 1996 by Bob McMullan, who had previously held one of the territory's Senate seats since 1988. McMullan moved to Fraser when the third electorate was abolished in 1998, which was the safer of the two for Labor, while Canberra went to Annette Ellis, who had entered parliament as the member for Namadgi in 1996. The existing member for Fraser, Steve Darvagel, agreed to go quietly after a brief parliamentary career that began when he succeeded John Langmore at a by-election in February 1997.</p>
			<p>Both Ellis and Brodtmann retired in 2010, at which point Canberra passed to Gai Brodtmann, a former Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade public servant who had established a local communications consultancy with her husband, Chris Uhlmann, then of the ABC and now of the Nine Network. Brodtmann bowed out in 2019 and was succeeded by Alicia Payne, who picked up a 4.1% swing at the election.</p>

The former area was gained from Fenner in 2019, when much of the old Canberra's territory was absorbed by the new seat of Bean.

			<p>Covering the northern end of Canberra, Fenner was known prior to the 2016 election as Fraser, and has been held for Labor in either incarnation by Andrew Leigh since 2010. Fraser was created when the single Australian Capital Territory electorate was divided into two in 1974, and unlike its counterpart Canberra has always been held by Labor.</p>
			<p>Andrew Leigh came to the seat in succession to Bob McMullan, who held an ACT Senate seat from 1988 to 1996, then moved to the Canberra electorate for a term, followed by a move to Fraser when the territory's short-lived third seat of Namadgi was abolished in 1998. This put an end to the short-lived parliamentary career of Steve Darvagel, who had retained Fraser for Labor at a by-election held in February 1997 upon the retirement of John Langmore, the member since 1984.</p>

Gungahlin in particular is known locally as &#8220;nappy valley&#8221;, with the electorate having the nation's sixth highest share of young children. The rearrangement caused by the territory's gain of a third seat in 2019 cost the electorate the city centre and surrounding suburbs to a redrawn Canberra.

A Julia Gillard loyalist, he gained the position of parliamentary secretary to the Prime Minister after Kevin Rudd's abortive leadership bid in March 2013, only to lose it when Rudd returned at the end of June.</p>
			<p>While remaining factionally unaligned, Leigh won promotion to the outer shadow ministry after the September 2013 election defeat as Assistant Shadow Treasurer. He maintained this status after the 2016 election despite having his pay cut to the level of a back-bencher, after Bill Shorten increased the size of the shadow ministry through his determination to retain Kim Carr when he lost the support of the Left.

			<p>Southern Sydney seat in which the Liberals achieved their first ever win in 2013, then decisively retained it in 2016 and 2019. Labor had held double-digit margins for two decades after the seat was created with the enlargement of parliament in 1949, but a narrowing trend became evident in the 1970s and 1980s.</p>
			<p>The margin fell below 2% on three occasions after Daryl Melham became the Labor member in 1990: with the defeat of the Keating government in 1996, the weak result for Labor under Mark Latham in 2004, and the anti-Labor backlash across Sydney in 2010. The swing on the latter occasion was 8.9%, reversing a 7.9% swing in Melham's favour in 2007.</p>
			<p>The seat has been held for the Liberals since 2013 by David Coleman, who accounted for Melham's 1.5% margin in 2013 with a 3.3% swing. A redistribution added 1.0% to Coleman's margin going into the 2016 election, at which Labor managed a swing of only 1.4% compared with 3.8% statewide. Coleman performed even more strongly in 2019, picking up a 4.8% swing compared with 1.3% statewide.</p>

		<background>
			<p>Inner southern Sydney seat held since 2016 by Linda Burney, who recovered it for Labor after the Liberals' first win in three decades in 2013. Redistribution transformed the seat between the two elections by reorienting it northwards, turning the 0.3% Liberal margin into a notional Labor margin of 4.4%. Burney has since boosted the margin further with successive swings of 3.9% and 1.1%.</p>
			<p>Barton has mostly been held by Labor since its creation in 1922, most notably when Herbert “Doc” Evatt held it through most of a tumultuous career from 1940 to 1958, when he sought refuge in the safer seat of Hunter. Evatt survived by margins of 243 votes in 1951, when his Liberal opponent was World War II hero Nancy Wake, and 226 votes in 1955. The Liberals would eventually gain the seat with the 1966 landslide and again through Malcolm Fraser's three election victories in 1975, 1977 and 1980.</p>
			<p>The seat was held for Labor through the 1980s by Gary Punch on modest margins, before successive swings in 1990 and 1993 added enough fat that Labor was able to retain it when Punch retired and the Keating government was heavily defeated in 1996. It was then held by Robert McClelland, who became Attorney-General with the election of the Rudd Government in 2007 but was delegated to the back bench in 2012 after supporting Rudd's efforts to return to the leadership.</p>
			<p>With McClelland's retirement in 2016, Kogarah mayor Nick Varvaris narrowly succeeded in gaining the seat for the Liberals with a 7.2% swing, the third highest in the state. Varvaris initially indicated he would bow out after the ensuing redistribution left him high and dry, but was ultimately prevailed upon to defend the seat. The initial draft of the redistribution went to so far as to push the electorate into Marrickville, prompting suggestions Anthony Albanese might transfer from Grayndler.</p>

			<p>Since its radical redrawing ahead of the 2016 election, Barton has encompassed the Botany Bay shore at Brighton-le-Sands, Earlwood in the north, Bexley and northern Kogarah in the south, and Hurstville in the west. It previously extended southwards to the mouth of the Georges River at Sans Souci, a Liberal-voting area that had been part of the electorate since its creation in 1922.</p>
			<p>As well as making the seat substantially stronger for Labor, the changes promoted the seat from sixth to fourth in the state for percentage of non-English speakers, mostly due to the gain of the Chinese community hub of Hurstville. Other multicultural focal points are Earlwood and Arncliffe, respectively associated with the Greek and Arabic communities.</p>

			<p>Cross-factional backing for Burney's preselection was gained through a deal in which the Right allowed Barton to pass to the Left in exchange for Joel Fitzgibbon of the Right remaining in Hunter, which had absorbed the majority of the abolished seat of Charlton. Burney was promptly elevated to shadow cabinet in the human services portfolio, which was renamed families and social services in August 2018.</p>

			<p>Inner northern Sydney seat that will be vacated at the election with the retirement of John Alexander, the member since 2010. Alexander recovered the seat for the Liberals in 2010 following the historic defeat of John Howard, whose defeat at the hands of Labor's Maxine McKew in 2007 made him the second serving Prime Minister to lose his seat after Stanley Bruce in the Victorian seat of Flinders in 1929.</p>
			<p>Howard's vulnerability was first established by the 2004 election, at which his margin was pared back from 7.8% to 4.3%. This was followed in 2007 by a decisive 5.5% swing to McKew, a veteran ABC political journalist who emerged as a steadfast ally of Kevin Rudd and a foe of Julia Gillard, of whom she was highly critical in a book published in 2012.</p>
			<p>McKew was unseated in 2010 by a 4.5% swing to John Alexander, a former tennis player and commentator who achieved a world ranking of number eight in 1975. Alexander gained a further 4.6% swing shortly after Rudd's return to the prime ministership in 2013, despite suggestions Rudd's popularity among the electorate's Asian voters had helped decide the result in 2007. He did even better to pick up a 2.0% swing in 2016, against the trend of a statewide Labor swing of 3.8%.</p>
			<p>Bennelong was the scene of the second by-election arising from the Section 44 drama in December 2017, after it emerged that Alexander held a dual citizenship through his British-born father. In the face of a high-profile Labor opponent in Kristina Keneally, Alexander suffered a swing of 4.8%, amounting to about half of his existing margin.

This was followed by five elections at which it was contested for the Liberals by Dobie and for Labor by Ray Thorburn, with Thorburn narrowly prevailing in 1972 and 1974 and Dobie doing so rather more comfortably in 1975, 1977 and 1980. After surviving by 148 votes in 1983, Dobie held the seat fairly comfortably through to his retirement in 1996.</p>
			<p>Dobie was succeeded by Stephen Mutch, who had been a member of the New South Wales Legislative Council since 1988. Mutch fell victim after one term to an exercise of power by the party's moderate faction, which at first backed local barrister Mark Speakman, who had been best man at Mutch's wedding nine years earlier. The resulting dispute was concluded with the installation of an alternative moderate, Bruce Baird, who had been a senior minister in the state Greiner-Fahey government from 1988 to 1995, and whose son Mike Baird served as Premier from 2014 to 2017.</p>
			<p>Mutch's demise displeased John Howard, who pointedly failed to promote Baird at any point in his nine years in Canberra. After reports his preselection was jeopardy, Baird retired ahead of the 2007 election, initiating a complicated and highly contentious preselection process that ended with the endorsement of Scott Morrison.</p>

			<p>Cook covers the suburbs of the eastern Sutherland Shire, including Kurnell, Cronulla, Miranda and Sylvania. It was substantially affected by the redistribution before the 2016 election, exchanging the western end of Sutherland Shire for the St George region suburbs of Sans Souci, Blakehurst and Monterey, without much impact on the margin. The seat became stronger for the Liberals as its demographic profile became older and wealthier, while remaining predominantly Anglo-Celtic by Sydney standards.</p>

		<candidates>
			<p><b>Scott Morrison</b> came to parliament upon the defeat of the Howard government in 2007 after a career as managing director of Tourism Australia and state director of the New South Wales Liberal Party. His preselection for Cook was contentiously accomplished after the party's state executive overturned a local party ballot result in favour of Michael Towke, who supporters claimed had been the subject of a whispering campaign about his Lebanese background.</p>
			<p>Morrison was promoted to the outer shadow ministry when Malcolm Turnbull became leader in September 2008, then gained the high-profile immigration portfolio when Tony Abbott deposed Turnbull in December 2009. His political role was sharpened after the 2013 election victory, when the job title was changed to Minister for Immigration and Border Protection. He publicly supported Abbott when Turnbull challenged him in 2015, but was accused of passively allowing the challenge to succeed by neglecting to rally his own supporters. These perceptions hardened when Morrison was promoted to Treasurer in place of Joe Hockey.</p>
			<p>Morrison remained behind Turnbull when Peter Dutton launched his challenge in August 2018, although there were suggestions he was manipulating the situation by directing enough of his own supporters to Dutton so that he might emerge as a compromise candidate. When Turnbull declined to put his name forward at a second vote later in the week, his backers fell in behind Morrison, who prevailed over Peter Dutton by 45 votes to 40. Morrison then led the Coalition to an unexpected win at the May 2019 election, securing a narrow majority of 77 out of 151 seats with 51.5% of the two-party preferred vote.</p>

			<p>Created at federation, the Mid North Coast seat of Cowper has been held by the National/Country Party for all but one term since 1919, with current member Patrick Conaghan succeeding Luke Hartsuyker in 2019. Conaghan prevailed at the election over a second comeback attempt by Rob Oakeshott, who had held neighbouring Lyne as an independent from 2008 to 2013 and changed his focus to Cowper after it gained Port Macquarie in a redistribution. Oakeshott fell short by 6.8% against Conaghan in 2019 and 4.6% against Hartsuyker in 2016.</p>
			<p>Cowper was held from 1919 to 1961 by Country Party founding father Earle Page, who served as Prime Minister for three weeks after the death of Joseph Lyons in 1939. Page contested the 1961 election despite being 81 and suffering from lung cancer, from which he died 11 days later without knowing he had finally lost his seat to Labor's Frank McGuren, who had achieved double digit swings at two consecutive elections. The Country Party recovered the seat in 1963 and have retained it since, although margins were narrow when Labor governments came to power in 1972 (2.5%), 1983 (2.1%) and 2007 (1.2%).</p>

			<p>To be vacated at the election with the retirement of Shoarn Bird, Cunningham is a Wollongong-based seat in which Labor has been defeated only once since its creation in 1949, when the Greens gained their first ever House of Representatives seat at a by-election in 2002. The member from 1963 to 1977 was Rex Connor, who came to the seat after a 13-year career in state politics and played a central part in the crises of 1975 through his role as Whitlam government Minerals and Energy Minister.</p>
			<p>Connor was succeeded after his death by Stewart West, who served in cabinet for the first three terms of the Hawke government. West came within 2.4% of losing the seat to the Australian Democrats in 1990, and was subsequently dropped from cabinet and then defeated for preselection by Stephen Martin ahead of the 1993 election.</p>
			<p>Martin's mid-term resignation in 2002 prompted the by-election at which the seat was won for the Greens by Michael Organ, who benefited from discontent over the Labor state executive's imposition of Sharon Bird as candidate and a large field of independents who directed preferences to him. Organ polled 23.0% of the primary vote to Bird's 38.1%, and snuck ahead after preferences to prevail at the final count by 2.2%.</p>

			<p>Central Coast seat that has been held for Labor by Emma McBride on narrow margins for two terms, having previously been one of the Liberals' eight gains in New South Wales in 2013. It was created with the enlargement of parliament in 1984 and held for Labor until 2001 by Michael Lee, who served as a Keating government cabinet minister from 1993 to 1996 and survived a 6.7% swing in 1996 by 1176 votes.</p>
			<p>Lee was less fortunate in a second close race in 2001, when Liberal candidate Ken Ticehurst prevailed by 560 votes after a 1.8% redistribution shift and a 1.9% swing. Ticehurst added 5.5% to his margin in 2004, but the resulting buffer proved insufficient against an 8.7% swing to Labor when the Rudd government came to power in 2007.</p>
			<p>Dobell was then held for two terms by Craig Thomson, former national secretary of the Health Services Union. Thomson was one of only four Labor MPs in New South Wales to pick up a swing at the 2010 election, despite news reports the previous year concerning his use of a corporate credit card while working for the HSU. This issue proved his downfall over the following term, and eventually led to a theft conviction in 2014. Thomson resigned from the ALP in 2012 and engaged in a quixotic bid to retain his seat as an independent in 2013, managing only 4.0% of the vote.</p>
			<p>Karen McNamara gained the seat for the Liberals at the 2013 election with a 5.8% swing, prevailing over Labor candidate Emma McBride by 0.7%. This narrow margin was eliminated in the ensuing redistribution, and McBride comfortably won a rematch in 2016 with a 4.6% swing.

			<p>Occupying the south-eastern corner of New South Wales since federation, Eden-Monaro maintained a celebrated record as an electoral bellwether from 1972 until 2016, when Mike Kelly recovered it at a losing election for Labor. Labor has since maintained a tenuous hold in the face of Liberal swings at both the 2019 election and the July 2020 by-election that brought current member Kristy McBain to the seat.</p>
			<p>Eden-Monaro was held by conservatives of various stripes for all but one term from 1901 to 1943, the exception being Labor's 40-vote win when Jim Scullin's government came to power in 1929. It was then held for Labor by Allan Fraser from 1943 until 1966, when he lost the seat for a term before recovering it in 1969.</p>
			<p>The seat's run as a bellwether began with Fraser's retirement at the 1972 election, at which it was narrowly retained for Labor by Bob Whan. The Country Party outperformed its conservative rival for the only times in the seat's history in 1972 and 1974, respectively coming within 503 and 146 votes of victory. However, there was a strong shift to the Liberals in the 1975 landslide, and it was held for them throughout the Fraser years by Murray Sainsbury.</p>
			<p>Jim Snow gained the seat for Labor with the election of the Hawke government in 1983, retaining it through to their eventual defeat in 1996. Snow was unseated by Gary Nairn, who duly held it for the Liberals through the Howard years until the government's defeat in 2007. It was then held for Labor by Mike Kelly, who bucked the statewide trend at the 2010 election to gain a swing of 2.0%.</p>
			<p>Eden-Monaro only barely remained true to its bellwether form in 2013, when Liberal candidate Peter Hendy prevailed over Kelly by 0.6% after a 4.8% swing. Kelly recovered the seat in 2016 with a 5.8% swing, and held on by 0.8% after a 2.1% swing back to the Liberals in 2019. He announced his resignation in April 2020, citing medical issues deriving from his overseas service while in the army, which had required surgery for kidney and gallbladder failure.</p>
			<p>The by-election that followed on July 4 resulted in narrow victory for Kirsty McBain over Liberal candidate Fiona Kotjovs, who fell 735 votes short of becoming the first by-election candidate to gain a seat for the party in government since 1920. Two senior figures in the state government, Deputy Premier John Barilaro and Transport Minister Andrew Constance, respectively sought preselection for the Nationals and the Liberals, but both withdrew shortly after Kelly's formal resignation. It was reported soon after that Barilaro had described Constance as a &#8220;c**t&#8221; in a text message to another cabinet colleague.</p>

			<p>Held for the Liberals since 2001 by Sussan Ley, Farrer was created with the enlargement of parliament in 1949 to accommodate Albury and Wagga Wagga, although today it encompasses only the former. The two towns had hitherto formed the basis of Hume, a name that was retained in an essentially new electorate further to the east. The 1949 election also marked a turning point in the area's electoral record, as Labor had held Hume more often than not over the previous 30 years, but would never do so with Farrer.</p>
			<p>Farrer was held by the Liberals until 1984, when the enlargement of parliament caused Wagga Wagga to be transferred to Hume (it is now in Riverina). This prompted sitting member Wal Fife to contest Hume instead, with Farrer being won for the Nationals by Tim Fischer, who had served the area as the state member for Sturt and Murray since 1971. Fischer went on to lead the Nationals from 1990, and was Deputy Prime Minister from 1996 until his resignation in mid-1999.</p>
			<p>Sussan Ley won Farrer for the Liberals by 206 votes when Fischer retired in 2001, after a heavy flow of preferences to the Nationals failed to chase down her 37.7% to 23.4% lead on the primary vote. She has retained the seat since on double-digit margins in the absence of further competition from the Nationals, peaking at 20.5% in 2016. In 2019 she faced a high-profile independent challenge from Albury mayor Kevin Mack, who comfortably outpolled Labor with 20.5% but proved no threat to Ley, given her majority on the primary vote.</p>

			<p>The seat will again be contested for the Liberals by <b>Sussan Ley</b> after intervention by the party's national executive secured her position together with two other incumbents, Trent Zimmerman in North Sydney and cabinet colleague Alex Hawke in Mitchell. This reportedly spared Ley a formidable preselection challenge from Christian Ellis, a public relations specialist who made a name locally campaigning for water rights. Local party branches had reportedly been targeted by a conservative recruitment drive, putting Ley in grave peril despite her status as Environment Minister.</p>
			<p>Ley was an Australian Taxation Office official for six years before entering parliament, and had earlier been an air traffic controller and farmer. She has had two spells in cabinet, as Health Minister from December 2014 to January 2017 and Environment Minister since the May 2019 election, interrupted by her resignation over an apartment she purchased during a visit to the Gold Coast while claiming travel entitlements.</p>

Her spell on the back bench from January 2017 ended when she was promoted to parliamentary secretary after Scott Morrison became Prime Minister in August 2018. Despite having supported Peter Dutton against both Scott Morrison and Malcolm Turnbull in the 2018 leadership ballots, she has variously been said to have loose ties with moderates and the centre right, and to have been closely associated in recent times with Morrison.</p>

			<p>Centred around the Vietnamese enclave of Cabramatta in western Sydney, the safe Labor seat of Fowler will be contested for the party at the coming election by the high-profile figure of Kristina Keneally, former New South Wales Premier and outgoing Senator. Keneally was contentiously chosen to succeed retiring incumbent Chris Hayes, who came to the seat in 2010 after previously holding Werriwa from 2005.</p>
			<p>Fowler was created in 1984 and held for Labor by Ted Grace until 1998, and then by Julia Irwin until 2010. It experienced a brief period of volatility when it swung to the Liberals by 13.8% in 2010 and then by 8.0% back to Labor against the trend of the 2013 election.</p>

			<p>Cabramatta is located 30 kilometres south-west of central Sydney, and provides the focal point of an electorate that extends north-west to Bossley Park, north-east to Fairfield East and south to Liverpool. Its Vietnamese community gives it the highest proportion of non-English speaking residents of any electorate in the country, and it also recorded the fifth highest no vote in the 2017 same-sex marriage survey at 63.7%. The boundaries were dramatically altered by the redistribution in 2016, which added Liverpool and Bossley Park while ceding nearly half the electorate's existing voters to Werriwa in the west.</p>

			<p>Labor candidate <b>Kristina Keneally</b> was raised and educated in the United States, living mostly in Ohio, before moving to Australia in 1994 and becoming youth services director at St Vincent de Paul. She entered politics in the state seat of Heffron in 2003, and was promptly elevated to cabinet in 2007 and the premiership in 2009. This followed the second leadership coup of the Labor government's disastrous final term in office, which ended at the March 2011 election with a record 13.4% swing that reduced Labor from 52 seats to 20.</p>
			<p>Keneally quit state parliament a year later to take up a position as chief executive of Basketball Australia, and maintained her profile as a political commentator for Sky News from July 2014. Her first attempt to enter federal politics came at the Bennelong by-election in December 2017, when Liberal member John Alexander had to recontest his Sydney seat after becoming embroiled in the Section 44 crisis. While her failure to gain the seat has been invoked by some as a continuation of her record of electoral failure, her 4.8% swing was the highest against an incumbent at any of the seven Section 44 by-elections.</p>
			<p>Keneally's opportunity finally arrived in February 2018, when she won the decisive endorsement of the New South Wales Right to fill the Senate vacancy created by Sam Dastyari's resignation. She was elevated to shadow cabinet in one of the New South Wales Right's designated positions after the 2019 election at the expense of Chifley MP Ed Husic, while also taking on the party's deputy leadership in the Senate.</p>
			<p>The decision by the party hierarchy to install Keneally in Fowler resolved a difficulty arising from the 2016 double dissolution, at which three of the four elected Labor Senators were allocated full six-year terms to expire in mid-2022. This left two Senators of the Right chasing re-election from the first and third positions on the party ticket, namely Keneally as Dastyari's successor and Deborah O'Neill, with Left faction member Jenny McAllister assured of second position.</p>
			<p>With O'Neill enjoying the decisive support of the Shop Distributive and Allied Employees Association for the top position, Keneally appeared set for relegation to third place and likely defeat unless she was accommodated elsewhere. However, using Fowler as a back stop for Keneally came with the substantial optical difficulty of a resident of Sydney's northern beaches being imposed on a western Sydney seat with the country's highest non-English speaking population.</p>
			<p>Compounding the difficulty was the fact that Chris Hayes and influential factional ally Tony Burke both wanted the seat to go to Tu Le, a 30-year-old lawyer and daughter of Vietnamese refugees. Keneally's preselection was nonetheless hustled through the party's national executive with the support of Anthony Albanese. Among those using the occasion to voice concern about lack of ethnic diversity in the parliamentary ALP were Cowan MP Anne Aly and, less directly, Wills MP Peter Khalil, both of Egyptian background.</p>
			<p>Keneally's faces a high-profile local competitor in independent candidate <b>Dai Le</b>, the deputy mayor of Fairfield. Le came within 2.1% of gaining the state seat of Cabramatta for the Liberals in the party’s 2011 landslide and polled 25.9% as an independent there in 2019. Her campaign is backed by Fairfield mayor Frank Carbone, who had earlier floated the possibility of running himself.</p>

			<p>Centred around the Shoalhaven region 200 kilometres south of Sydney, Gilmore looms as one of the most important contests of the election, with local state Liberal member and former senior minister Andrew Constance seeking to recover the only seat gained by Labor in 2019 without assistance from a redistribution. Labor candidate Fiona Phillips won the seat on that occasion on her second attempt, gaining a 3.3% swing against the statewide trend to prevail by 2.6%.</p>
			<p>With the retirement of Ann Sudmalis, who had held the seat since 2010, the Liberal campaign was beset by dissension over the prime ministerially mandated preselection of Warren Mundine, a member of the Bandjalung people and one-time Labor national president and Senate candidate. This came at the expense of Grant Schultz, son of former Hume MP Alby Schultz, who registered his displeasure by running as an independent.</p>
			<p>Matters were further complicated by the entry of former state government minister Katrina Hodgkinson as the candidate of the Nationals, who had not previously contested the seat since 1993. Mundine finished well clear of his conservative rivals, but enough of their preferences leaked to deliver victory to Phillips despite a 3.0% drop in the Labor primary vote.</p>
			<p>Gilmore was a more rurally oriented seat when created in 1984, and was held for its first decade by the Nationals. An exchange of rural areas for Kiama helped Peter Knott gain the seat for Labor in 1993, and caused the Liberals to supplant the Nationals as the competitive Coalition party.</p>
			<p>Joanna Gash gained the seat for the Liberals with the defeat of the Keating government in 1996, picking up a swing of 6.7%. Her margins tended to increase through to her retirement in 2013, most notably when she picked up a 10.1% swing in 2001 against a comeback bid by Peter Knott, who asserted during the campaign that the recent September 11 attacks had been a case of American foreign policy &#8220;coming back to bite them&#8221;.</p>
			<p>Ann Sudmalis had an unspectacular electoral debut in 2013, suffering a 2.7% swing despite the heavy defeat of the Labor government. She was saved in 2016 by a redistribution that added 1.3% to her margin, giving her enough fat to survive another swing to Labor of 3.0%. On announcing her retirement in 2018, Sudmalis attributed the decision to the &#8220;bullying, betrayal and backstabbing&#8221; of party colleague Gareth Ward, factional moderate and state member for Kiama.</p>

			<p>Gilmore covers a stretch of southern coastal New South Wales, starting in the north from Kiama at the southern edge of the Illawarra region and extending through Nowra to Ulladulla to the Batemans Bay region. Such is its combination of Labor-leaning urban areas and conservative rural ones that it is actually the wealthier end of the electorate that is stronger for Labor. The electorate is otherwise notable demographically for having the nation's second highest median age, along with the twelfth lowest median income.</p>
			<p>On its creation in 1984, Gilmore extended inland through Goulburn all the way to Cowra and Young, with the Kiama region at that time accommodated by Throsby (the name of which has since changed to Whitlam). The exchange of the former for the latter changed the character of the electorate to the advantage of both Labor and Liberal and the disadvantage of the Nationals. The redistribution before the 2016 election shifted the electorate southwards, adding Batemans Bay from Eden-Monaro and transferring Shellharbour to Whitlam.</p>

The position then went to Gladys Berejiklian, and he served thereafter as Transport Minister. Constance received sympathetic media attention after nearly losing his Malua Bay house during the 2019/20 bushfires, which famously devolved into a public relations disaster for Scott Morrison, making him a potentially substantial asset to the Liberals as a federal election candidate in the region.</p>
			<p>Constance resigned from cabinet in May 2020 and announced his intention to seek preselection for the Eden-Monaro federal by-election, leading to a collision with state Nationals leader John Barilaro, who planned to contest it for the Nationals. Both withdrew, amid some apparent acrimony, and Constance lingered on the back bench before announcing his designed on Gilmore amid the turmoil that followed Berejiklian's resignation as Premier.</p>
			<p>Constance first had to overcome local preselectors who appeared hostile to the appearance of having a candidate foisted upon them following the Warren Mundine experience in 2019, a factor that also played against him in Eden-Monaro.

The seat then passed to Frank Stewart after the abolition of his neighbouring seat of Lang, which he had held since 1953, leaving Whitlam to make a dismally unsuccessful run for St George, the predecessor of today's seat of Watson.</p>
			<p>Frank Stewart died of a heart attack at the age of 56 in 1979, resulting in a by-election at which the seat was retained for Labor by Leo McLeay. McLeay held the seat through to 1993, distinguishing himself as a powerbroker of the New South Wales Right and a distinctly controversial Speaker from 1989 to 1993. It was then held for a term by Jeannette McHugh after the abolition of her seat of Phillip, encompassing Bondi and Randick, where she had been the member since 1983. Anthony Albanese then came to the seat upon McHugh's retirement in 1996.</p>

			<p>Neighbouring the electorate of Sydney to its east, Grayndler encompasses Leichhardt in the centre, northern Ashfield in the west, northern Marrickville in the south, Annandale in the east, and the Balmain peninsula in the north. It has the highest median income of any Labor-held seat, and a characteristically inner-city age distribution dominated by persons in their thirties and forties. The electorate recorded a 79.9% yes vote in the 2017 same-sex marriage survey, the fifth highest in the country.</p>
			<p>Grayndler has been substantially redrawn on a number of occasions since its creation in 1949, the only constant being Marrickville. It originally extended southwards to Tempe and Mascot, while the northern parts of today's electorate were accommodated by the since-abolished seats of Dalley, Evans, Parkes and Martin. The 1969 redistribution drew Grayndler northwards by abolishing Dalley, followed by a reorientation westward when Evans was abolished in 1977, at which point it extended from Ashfield and Dulwich Hill in the east to Belmore in the west.</p>
			<p>Grayndler reverted to more familiar territory around Marrickville, Leichhardt and Ashfield in 1993, when the abolition of the beachside seat of Phillip drew both Grayndler and Sydney eastwards. The redistribution before the 2016 election added the Balmain peninsula for the first time, which had previously been in Sydney, balanced by substantial losses to Watson in the west and Barton in the south.</p>

			<p><b>Anthony Albanese</b> emerged as a figure of influence in the ALP while working as a staffer to Hawke government minister Tom Uren and New South Wales Premier Bob Carr, in time becoming identified with a Left sub-faction distinct from that associated with Julia Gillard, whom he opposed through the leadership turmoil that plagued the party between 2010 and 2013.</p>
			<p>After entering parliament in 1996, Albanese progressed to shadow parliamentary secretary in 1998, the outer shadow ministry in 2001 and shadow cabinet in 2004. He served throughout Labor's period in government from 2007 to 2013 as Transport and Infrastructure Minister, and replaced Wayne Swan as Deputy Prime Minister when Kevin Rudd finally returned to the leadership in June 2013. He also added broadband, communications and the digital economy to his ministerial workload at this time.</p>
			<p>In the wake of the 2013 election defeat, Albanese faced Bill Shorten in the first ever Labor leadership ballot in which half the vote was determined by the party membership. Albanese won 59.9% out of around 30,000 party membership votes, but Shorten overcame this with a 55-31 win in the party room vote. Albanese maintained the infrastructure and transport portfolio through to the 2019 election defeat, after which he emerged as leader unopposed.</p>

			<p>Western Sydney seat that has been held for Labor for all but two terms since its creation in 1984, with current member Michelle Rowland maintaining a precarious grip since 2010. Russell Gorman held the seat for Labor on double-digit margins during the Hawke-Keating years, but the margin was slashed from 13.4% to 3.4% in 1996, when Gorman's retirement coincided with the landslide defeat of the Keating government.</p>
			<p>The seat was unexpectedly gained for the Liberals in 2004 by Hillsong Church community worker Louise Markus after the retirement of Gorman's successor, Frank Mossfield. Markus was assisted by an 11.8% informal vote amid a large field of candidates, and perhaps also by an underhanded campaign against Labor candidate Ed Husic, a non-practising Muslim of Bosnian origin who eventually found a berth in Chifley in 2010.</p>
			<p>The electorate underwent a short-lived but dramatic transformation in the redistribution before the 2007 election, when it traded the Labor bastion of Bankstown for the conservative Hawkesbury region. This delivered a timely 10.4% boost to Markus ahead of the defeat of the Howard government, and she duly retained the seat in the face of a 6.8% swing. When the subsequent redistribution largely reversed these changes ahead of the 2010 election, Markus moved to the seat of Macquarie, which had absorbed the Hawkesbury region, and retained it until her defeat in 2016.</p>
			<p>Michelle Rowland had a notional Labor margin of 5.8% to defend on her debut in 2010, but was barely able to hang on amid a Sydney-wide backlash against Labor that reduced the margin in Greenway to 0.9%. She then defied the trend of the 2013 election to gain a swing of 2.1%, with help from a disastrous campaign by twice-unsuccessful Liberal candidate Jaymes Diaz. This was followed by a further Labor swing of 3.3% in 2016, followed by a 3.5% swing back to the Liberals in 2019.</p>

			<p>Prior to Greenway's creation in 1984, Blacktown was in the safe Labor seat of Chifley while the northern end of today's electorate was in Mitchell, a once-marginal seat that had become safe for the Liberals.

			<p>Southern Sydney seat held by the controversial Craig Kelly, who will seek re-election with Clive Palmer's United Australia Party after resigning from the Liberal Party in February 2021. Hughes has evolved since its creation in 1955 from fairly safe Labor to fairly safe Liberal, partly due to the loss of its former territory at the northern end of the Illawarra region. The watershed came in 1996, when Liberal candidate Danna Vale defeated Keating government Aboriginal affairs minister Robert Tickner with an 11.4% swing.</p>
			<p>Vale's win was widely seen to exemplify a realignment achieved by John Howard in the nation's outer suburbs, an impression that was strengthened when she picked up further swings over the next three elections, including in 1998 when there was a 4.6% swing to Labor nationally. She retained the seat in the face of the Howard government's defeat in 2007 by 2.2%, having lost 2.2% to a redistribution adjustment and 6.4% to a Labor swing.</p>
			<p>Craig Kelly succeeded Vale upon her retirement in 2010, adding 4.6% to the Liberal margin amid a backlash against Labor throughout Sydney. Kelly gained a further 5.5% swing with the Labor government's defeat in 2013, which was followed by swings of 2.5% to Labor in 2016 and 0.5% to Liberal in 2019.</p>

			<p>Hughes was created in 1955 mostly to accommodate the rapid post-war urbanisation of Sutherland Shire, from which it extended southwards to the northern end of the Illawarra region. Much of Sutherland Shire was hived off to the new seat of Cook in 1969 and the northern Illawarra was detached when parliament was enlarged in 1984, leaving Hughes focused around Menai, Heathcote and Holsworthy.</p>
			<p>On its current boundaries, Hughes covers two distinct areas separated by the Holsworthy army base: the western end of the Sutherland Shire, including Sutherland, Menai and Engadine, and the south-eastern corner of the City of Liverpool, which includes Holsworthy and Moorebank. The redistribution before the 2016 election expanded the former area and reduced the latter, adding 1.1% to the Liberal margin.</p>

			<p><b>Craig Kelly</b> was a furniture importer and founder of the Southern Sydney Retailers Association prior to his election in Hughes in 2010. Despite remaining on the back bench, he built a profile as a climate change skeptic, promoter of coal-fired power and enthusiastic supporter of Tony Abbott.</p>
			<p>Malcolm Turnbull nonetheless gave Kelly decisive support in the face of a preselection challenge before the 2016 election from Kent Johns, a Sutherland Shire councillor and factional moderate. Johns re-emerged as a threat in 2018, with moderate attitudes reportedly hardening towards Kelly after his role in Turnbull's demise. Kelly did not help his own cause when he suggested Russia be forgiven for the MH17 disaster, but Scott Morrison came to his rescue by prevailing on the state executive to rubber-stamp preselections for all sitting members.</p>
			<p>Kelly became a still greater headache for the government with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, as he used his popular Facebook page to promote ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine as treatments for the illness, a notion popular on the political right but not with health authorities. He quit the Liberal Party in February 2021, citing his need to speak independently on such subjects, while promising to continue supporting the government on confidence and supply. He joined Clive Palmer's United Australian Party the following August, and has since featured heavily in its voluminous cross-media advertising.</p>
			<p>Following a turbulent preselection process, the Liberal candidate is <b>Jenny Ware</b>, a factional moderate who works as a lawyer at Georges River Council. Ware was among the candidates imposed in early April after intervention by the Liberal Party national executive without reference to party members, but her selection appeared to be a concession to local party sentiment, as she would by all accounts have been competitive in a rank-and-file ballot.</p>
			<p>Ware's main competitor in such a ballot would have been Melanie Gibbons, the state member for Holsworthy, who had been favoured by Scott Morrison. However, this had been opposed by Dominic Perrottet, who did not wish to fight the by-election that would result in Gibbons' loseable seat. A thwarted faction deal had earlier sought to install Alex Dore, Manly-resident PwC Australia management consultant, but this met fierce opposition from the local membership.</p>
			<p>Labor's initial choice of candidate was Peter Tsambalas, a teacher at Aquinas Catholic College, but he was obliged to withdraw in early April when it became apparent he would not be able to complete the process of renouncing a Greek citizenship inherited from his migrant parents in time to avoid disqualification under Section 44.

	<district id="Hume" name="Hume">
		<background>
			<p>Encompassing Goulburn and the southern fringes of Sydney, Hume has been in conservative hands since 1974, with Angus Taylor holding the seat for the Liberals since 2013. It has existed in name since federation, but is today unrecognisable as the electorate that was created in 1901, which covered Albury and surrounding territory near the Victorian border. Goulburn has been a mainstay since 1993, and the electorate has since been drawn into Sydney fringe territory around Camden while ceding rural areas further to the west.</p>
			<p>Hume changed hands between the Country Party and Labor with great regularity between 1919 until 1974, after which the Labor vote went into long-term decline. The Liberals first won the seat when Wagga Wagga was added to it in 1984, setting up a contest in which Wal Fife, the Liberal member for Farrer since 1975 and previously the state member for Wagga Wagga from 1957, defeated Stephen Lusher, who had held Hume for the Nationals since 1974.</p>
			<p>With the retirement of Fife and the addition of Goulburn to the electorate in 1993, Hume was recovered for the Nationals by John Sharp, who had previously held Gilmore since 1984, which duly fell to Labor in his absence. A travel rorts scandal cost Sharp his job as Transport Minister during the first term of the Howard government, and he retired in 1998.</p>
			<p>In a remarkable turn-around on the previous three-cornered contest in 1993, the Nationals polled less than 10% at the 1998 election, and have not contested the seat since. It was then held for the Liberals by Alby Schultz, who had held the state seat of Burrinjuck from 1988 to 1998. The margin against Labor fell to 4.2% in 2007, but it tipped back into double digits in 2013, when Schultz was succeeded by Angus Taylor, and has remained there since.</p>

			<p>Hume is broadly centred around Goulburn, 200 kilometres south-west of central Sydney, from which the electorate extends north-east to Camden on the fringes of Sydney and westwards to the shires of Upper Lachlan and Boorowa. The electorate ranked second behind Riverina for highest proportion of persons identifying as Christian in the 2016 census.</p>
			<p>The electorate's evolution since federation has been a story of northern migration that has broadly followed the highway that bears its name. Originally centred on Albury, it further acquired Wagga Wagga in 1906, before both were transferred to the new seat of Farrer in 1949. The next enlargement of parliament in 1984 shifted the electorate back to Wagga Wagga, but this was exchanged in 1993 for Goulburn, which had been in Gilmore since 1984 and previously in Eden-Monaro. It was brought to the edge of Sydney in 2001, and then into Camden in 2016, which had previously been in Macarthur.</p>

			<p>Liberal member <b>Angus Taylor</b> is a former lawyer, Rhodes scholar and triathlete who won preselection for Hume in 2013 with support from Alby Schultz and Tony Abbott. Despite being noted as a conservative, he was also said to have been close to Malcolm Turnbull, and his loyalties were rated &#8220;uncertain&#8221; in The Australian's accounting of Turnbull's successful leadership challenge in September 2015. There was no such ambiguity in August 2018, when he joined the front bench exodus of Peter Dutton supporters ahead of his challenge to Turnbull and remained behind Dutton in the second ballot against Scott Morrison.</p>
			<p>There was some surprise when Taylor failed to win promotion to Turnbull's new ministry, but he was promoted to parliamentary secretary the following February, the outer ministry as Minister for Law Enforcement and Cybersecurity in December 2017, and ultimately to cabinet as Energy Minister when Scott Morrison became leader in August 2018. This appointment was controversial due to Taylor's long-standing hostility to wind power and renewable energy targets. The portfolio was renamed energy and emissions reduction after the 2019 election, and he further gained industry when Christian Porter resigned in October 2021.</p>
			<p>Taylor faced a preselection threat ahead of the 2016 election when a redistribution transferred into Hume party branches dominated by Russell Matheson, member for neighbouring Macarthur, where the Liberal margin had been slashed from 11.8% to 3.4%. Matheson's designs on Hume caused consternation due to Taylor's reputation as a ministerial it not leadership prospect, and the absence of any such expectation for Matheson. Matheson was prevailed upon by Malcolm Turnbull to stand his ground in Macarthur, only to be routed by an 11.7% swing to Labor, while Taylor was comfortably returned in Hume.</p>
			<p>Taylor's rise has been complicated by a series of controversies and scandals, including his accusation in September 2019 that Sydney Lord Mayor Clover Moore had overseen extravagant travel expenses at Sydney City Council. This took the form of a letter addressed to Moore but provided first to the Daily Telegraph, in the well-founded expectation that the paper would be use it to fashion a hit piece about Moore's hypocrisy on climate change. However, the move backfired when it became clear the supporting document had been doctored, in circumstances that have never been explained.</p>

	<district id="Hunter" name="Hunter">
		<background>
			<p>Covering the interior of the Hunter region, Hunter will be vacated at the election with the retirement of Joel Fitzgibbon, who has held it for Labor since 1996. The electorate produced one of the most striking results of the 2019 election, recording a 9.5% swing against Labor and the highest One Nation vote in the country. This was widely attributed to the local importance of the mining industry and hostility towards Labor's climate change policies, towards which member Joel Fitzgibbon became increasingly critical after the election, culminating in his resignation from shadow cabinet in November 2020.</p>
			<p>Hunter has existed as an electorate since federation, and was held on its inauguration by Australia's first Prime Minister, Edmund Barton. It became safe for Labor with the development of the area's mining and industrial base from 1910 onwards, with members including Matthew Charlton (1910-28), who had a fruitless spell as Opposition Leader in his last six years in parliament, and Bert &#8220;Doc&#8221; Evatt (1958-60), who sought refuge in the seat after repeatedly being run close in his Sydney seat of Barton.</p>
			<p>Hunter has been in the Fitzgibbon family since 1966, having been held by Eric Fitzgibbon until 1996 and his son thereafter. The creation of the Charlton electorate in 1984 resulted in Hunter being redrawn with a less urban orientation, which slashed the margin from 22.6% to 5.0%, but it remained in the Labor fold on generally increasing margins over the following decades. An 8.8% swing pared the margin back to 3.7% in 2013, but Labor's margin was boosted first by 2.0% with the abolition of Charlton in 2016 and then by 6.8% at the 2016 election, giving Fitzgibbon enough fat to survive the backlash of 2019.</p>

			<p>Hunter covers the interior shore of Lake Macquarie at its eastern end, an area encompassing Cooranbong and Morriset in the south, Toronto in the centre, and the Newcastle outskirts around Glendale in the north. From there it extends west to the Hunter Valley coal and electricity towns of Cessnock, Singleton and Muswellbrook. The electorate had the nation's fourth highest share of the workforce in mining as of the 2016 census, after Durack and O'Connor in Western Australia and Capricornia in Queensland.</p>
			<p>Cessnock has been a mainstay of Hunter amid shifting boundaries over the years, which variously extended it north into the Hunter Valley, east into Newcastle or south to Lake Macquarie. The former orientation prevailed after 1984, when Charlton was created to accommodate the Lake Macquarie region. This was greatly to Labor's disadvantage in Hunter, since it was balanced by the addition of rural territory, though not to the extent that it cost Labor the seat.</p>
			<p>With the abolition of Charlton in 2016, Hunter absorbed the full length of the western shore of Lake Macquarie, such that the redrawn Hunter drew a slight majority of its voters from the abolished seat. The gains were mainly balanced by the transfer of the area around Maitland and Kurri Kurri to Paterson, with a combined positive effect of 2.0% on the Labor margin.</p>

		<background>
			<p>Based around Penrith 50 kilometres west of Sydney, Lindsay has boasted an eventful recent history, having changed hands at four of the last five elections. Melissa McIntosh gained the seat for the Liberals in 2019 by an unusually solid 5.0% margin with a 6.1% swing, after Labor effectively blocked one-term member Emma Husar from preselection.</p>
			<p>Lindsay was held for Labor by Ross Free for 12 years after its creation in 1984, and was generally reckoned in that time to be a fairly safe seat. This illusion was dispelled with the defeat of the Keating government in 1996, when Free was unseated by Liberal candidate Jackie Kelly with an 11.9% swing. Kelly was made to face the voters again the following December after Free succeeded in having her disqualified on the grounds that her previous position as an RAAF officer constituted an office for profit under the Crown, but she was reconfirmed at the ensuing by-election with a further 5.0% swing.</p>
			<p>Kelly's re-election in 1998, 2001 and 2004 encouraged a view that Lindsay embodied John Howard's key constituency of moderately prosperous skilled workers in the outer suburbs, as well as illustrating Kelly's appeal to local voters. Howard was duly dismayed when Kelly retired at the 2007 election, just as a redistribution cut the Liberal margin from 5.3% to 2.3%. Any remaining Liberal hopes were sunk in the last days of the campaign when the husbands of Kelly and the new Liberal candidate, Karen Chijoff, were caught distributing fake pamphlets seeking to tie Labor to Islamic terrorism.</p>
			<p>Lindsay was held for Labor the next two terms by former Penrith mayor David Bradbury, who succeeded on the third attempt in 2007 with a 9.7% swing. Labor strategists became increasingly concerned about the seat ahead of the 2010 election, particularly after a 25.7% swing to the Liberals at a by-election for the corresponding state seat of Penrith just five days before Kevin Rudd was dumped as Prime Minister in June 2010. The party's national secretary, Karl Bitar, reportedly demanded that all policy proposals be evaluated according to a &#8220;Lindsay test&#8221;, inspiring a tougher line on asylum seekers and a shift in prime ministerial rhetoric from Kevin Rudd's &#8220;big Australia&#8221; to Julia Gillard's &#8220;sustainable Australia&#8221;.</p>
			<p>Labor was at least successful in retaining the seat in 2010, with Bradbury surviving a 4.8% swing to the Liberals by 1.1%, which has proved to be the only occasion out of the last five elections when the seat failed to change hands. Liberal candidate Fiona Scott succeeded on her second attempt in 2013, deposing Bradbury with a 4.1% swing, but lasted only one term before an almost identical swing the other way delivered the seat to Emma Husar.</p>
			<p>Husar's career began to unravel in July 2018 when it emerged she was the subject of an internal party investigation over workplace bullying and misconduct, capped by accounts of sexual harassment and indecent exposure related by Buzzfeed. The investigation upheld complaints of offensive and unreasonable conduct towards staff, but rejected the allegations in the Buzzfeed report, prompting a defamation action from Husar. Husar announced she would not recontest the seat amid the resulting furore, but changed her mind in November 2018. However, the party hierarchy blocked her path, having by that time preselected former state member Diane Beamer.</p>

Current member David Gillespie recovered it for the Nationals when Oakeshott bowed out in 2013, and Oakeshott shifted his efforts to neighbouring Cowper when he made unsuccessful comeback bids in 2016 and 2019, his home base of Port Macquarie having been transferred to it in a redistribution.</p>
			<p>Lyne was held by the Nationals from its creation in 1949 to 2008, although Oakeshott's predecessor, Mark Vaile, only narrowly held off a Liberal candidate when he succeeded Bruce Cowan in 1993. Vaile went on to serve as Nationals leader from July 2005 to the defeat of the Howard government in November 2007, and retired from parliament nine months later. Rob Oakeshott gained the seat at the ensuing by-election with an emphatic 63.8% of the primary vote, having previously held the state seat of Port Macquarie first for the Nationals from 1996 and then as an independent after he quit the party in 2002.</p>
			<p>Oakeshott's decision to support a Labor minority government after his re-election in 2010 was not favourably received locally, and he joined his fellow country independent, New England MP Tony Windsor, in announcing he would not recontest his seat hours before Julia Gillard was deposed as Prime Minister in June 2013.

It also has the country's second lowest proportion of non-English speakers.</p>
			<p>The electorate's character was fundamentally changed by the redistribution before the 2016 election, when the abolition of a seat in the Hunter region caused it to be drawn southwards. This entailed the loss of its former focal point of Port Macquarie, which now forms the northern extremity of Cowper, but not the nearby towns of Wauchope and Laurieton. The current boundaries are broadly similar to those that applied from 1977 to 1993, the only previous period when the electorate was not centred on Port Macquarie.</p>

			<p>Covering shifting territory on the southern fringe of Sydney since 1949, Macarthur was an electoral bellwether until 2007, but has since been won by the winning party only at the election that brought the Abbott government to power in 2013. Michael Freelander gained the seat for Labor in 2016 with a swing of 11.7%, the second biggest of the election, and retained his solid margin in defiance of the general trend of the 2019 election.</p>
			<p>Macarthur's bellwether record was broken when Pat Farmer narrowly retained it for the Liberals in the face of a 10.4% swing upon the defeat of the Howard government. He was then soundly defeated for Liberal preselection at the 2010 election by Russell Matheson, having alienated local opinion by moving to the affluent lower north shore suburb of Mosman. A redistribution had left Macarthur with a notional Labor margin going into the election, but Matheson was able to retain the seat with a 3.5% swing, to which he added a further 8.3% in 2013.</p>
			<p>The Liberals were once again weakened by redistribution going into the 2016 election, when a move deeper into suburban Sydney cut the margin from 11.4% to 3.0%. Matheson hoped for a transfer to neighbouring Hume, which had absorbed some of his strongest party branches in Camden, but Malcolm Turnbull insisted it remain with rising ministerial prospect Angus Taylor, notwithstanding that Taylor was aligned with the unfriendly conservative factional forces. Matheson went on to suffer an emphatic defeat in Macarthur at the hands of Mike Freelander by a margin of 8.3%, to which Freelander added a further 0.1% in 2019.</p>
			<p>Earlier members of Macarthur included John Kerin, who held it for Labor through the Whitlam years from 1972 to 1975; Michael Baume, the Liberal member during the Fraser government from 1975 to 1983; and former New South Wales Premier John Fahey, the Liberal member from 1996 to 2001. Both Kerin and Baume returned to parliament after their defeats, Kerin in Werriwa and Baume as a Senator.</p>

			<p>Macarthur is centred around Campbelltown, 50 kilometres south-west of central Sydney, and encompasses suburban territory around the Hume Motorway and semi-rural areas to the north. Urban expansion on the fringe of Sydney has made the seat prone to dramatic changes at redistributions. It was oriented considerably further to the south when created in 1969, encompassing parts of the Illawarra until 1993, and would not assume its suburban character until 2001. The redistribution that slashed the Liberal margin in 2016 added 40,000 voters at what is now the northern end of the electorate, around Ingleburn, Eagle Vale and Minto, while transferring Camden and its surrounds to Hume.</p>

			<p>Presently encompassing the Blue Mountains and the Hawkesbury region of north-western Sydney, Macquarie has been held for Labor on narrow margins for the past two terms by Susan Templeman. It had previously held for the Liberals from 2010 to 2016 by Louise Markus, who came to the seat after the Hawkesbury region was transferred from her existing seat of Greenway, which she had held since 2004. Templeman unseated Markus on her third attempt by a 2.2% margin after a 6.7% swing in 2016, then held out by 0.2% in the face of a 2.0% swing back to the Liberals in 2019.</p>
			<p>Macquarie was comfortably held for the Liberals through the Howard years by Kerry Bartlett, before a redistribution ahead of the 2007 election eliminated his margin by reorienting the seat around Bathurst and Lithgow. It was then held for Labor for a term by Bob Debus, a veteran state government minister who had held the seat of Blue Mountains. The 2010 election saw the retirement of Debus and another transformation by redistribution, exchanging Bathurst and Lithgow for the Hawkesbury region, such that a 1.5% swing was sufficient for Markus to overcome a negligible notional Labor margin.</p>
			<p>The electorate's most distinguished past member is Ben Chifley, the Prime Minister from 1945 to 1949, who was born and raised in Bathurst and first elected to the seat in 1928. Chifley was voted out in the 1931 landslide, and twice failed to recover it before finally breaking through in 1940. Labor went undefeated from then until the twin disasters of 1975 and 1977, before recovering it in 1980. The seat became more rurally oriented between 1984 and 2007, in which time Labor's only win was by a 164-vote margin in 1993.</p>

Labor has held the seat since its creation in 1969, its previous members being Richard Klugman until 1990 and Janice Crosio until 2004. Labor's grip has slackened somewhat over the past decade, with successive swings of 6.0% and 2.5% reducing the margin to 5.3% in 2013, followed by a 7.5% swing back to Labor in 2016 and a 5.5% reverse in 2019.</p>

The remainder are in the City of Penrith suburbs of St Clair and Erskine Park in the electorate's north-west.</p>
			<p>There are marked demographic disparities between the two areas, with English speakers accounting for over three-quarters of the population in St Clair and Erskine Park, compared with barely a fifth at the eastern end. It was presumably the latter that accounted for the electorate having the third highest no vote in the country in the 2017 same-sex marriage survey, at 64.9%.

			<p>Liberal member <b>Alex Hawke</b> is the Morrison government's Immigration Minister and a long-standing party powerbroker as the dominant figure in the centre right faction. He has secured a continuation of his parliamentary career in the most contentious of circumstances, having emerged as a beneficiary of a national executive intervention that spared him and two other incumbents, Trent Zimmerman in North Sydney and cabinet colleague Sussan Ley in Farrer, from strongly backed preselection challenges.</p>
			<p>Hawke's critics accused him of having brought the intervention on by persistently clogging up the New South Wales' entire preselection process by persistently failing to attend meetings of the party's nomination review committees, without which the process could not move forward. This was said to have been motivated by concern at his own ability to hold off a challenge from Michael Abrahams, an army colonel with strong backing among conservatives, together with the marginalised position of the centre right more broadly, which had been frozen out by deals between moderates and the hard right.</p>
			<p>Hawke came to parliament in 2007 having acquired a formidable reputation as a numbers man while working as an electorate officer and adviser to various federal and state MPs. A momentous split in 2009 between Hawke and one of his former employers, state upper house MP David Clarke, left Hawke as the figurehead of a faction that has since been identified as the centre right, which forms a bedrock of Scott Morrison's support base.</p>
			<p>Despite his factional clout, Hawke had to wait until Malcolm Turnbull's ascension to the prime ministership in September 2015 to achieve parliamentary secretary status, eventually followed by promotion to the outer ministry as Special Minister of State when Scott Morrison became Prime Minister in August 2018. Hawke's loyalties were considered uncertain when Turnbull deposed Tony Abbott, but he lined up against Peter Dutton when he moved a spill motion against Malcolm Turnbull in August, then organised for Scott Morrison as Turnbull's position became untenable.</p>
			<p>Hawke remained in the outer ministry after the 2019 election, first as Minister for International Development and the Pacific and Assistant Defence Minister, then in immigration and related portfolios from December 2020. He was finally promoted to cabinet without changing his portfolio load after Christian Porter's resignation in September 2021.</p>

			<p>Rural northern New South Wales seat that returned to its usual form as a Nationals stronghold when Barnaby Joyce moved to it from his Queensland Senate seat in 2013, after being held by independent Tony Windsor since 2001. Windsor came out of retirement to challenge Joyce in 2016, but Joyce maintained a majority on the primary vote and an 8.5% margin after preferences. He scored an even more emphatic victory  when he was sent back to the polls as part of the wave of Section 44 disqualifications in December 2017, and again won a primary vote majority in 2019, when independent Adam Blakester finished second without troubling Joyce.</p>
			<p>New England was held from 1963 to 1998 by Ian Sinclair, who served as Nationals leader in opposition from 1984 to 1989 and later as Speaker in the last year of his parliamentary career. His successor, Stuart St Clair, lasted only one term before being unseated by Tony Windsor in 2001. Windsor had previously been the state member for Tamworth, to which he was elected as an independent in 1991 after being denied Nationals preselection, and re-elected on emphatic margins in 1995 and 1999.</p>
			<p>Windsor was similarly successful in New England through to the 2010 election, the result of which placed him on the cross bench of a hung parliament. His decision to join Lyne independent Rob Oakeshott in supporting a Labor minority government was shown by polling to have been unpopular with his constituents, and both he and Oakeshott announced they would not seek re-election hours before Julia Gillard was deposed as Prime Minister in June 2013.</p>

			<p><b>Barnaby Joyce</b> owned an accountancy practice in St George in the Darling Downs region before he was first elected to parliament as a Senator for Queensland in 2004. Despite a penchant for crossing the floor, he rose to the party's Senate leadership in September 2008, although he had to wait until Tony Abbott became Liberal leader in December 2009 before winning promotion to shadow cabinet.</p>
			<p>Joyce's plan for a lower house seat at the 2013 election originally focused on the Queensland seat of Maranoa, but he was thwarted by sitting member Bruce Scott's determination to serve another term. New England was another favoured option, despite being on the other side of the state border, since Joyce had been born and raised there and was evidently confident in his ability to unseat Tony Windsor.</p>
			<p>However, the Nationals had already pulled off an apparent coup in New England by enlisting Richard Torbay, who had held the state seat of Northern Tablelands as an independent since 1999. Joyce's opportunity arrived when Torbay withdrew shortly before the Independent Commission Against Corruption raided his home. He was duly preselected in Torbay's place, and his path to parliament was further smoothed when Windsor announced he would not recontest the seat.</p>
			<p>Joyce became Agriculture Minister with the Coalition's September 2013 election win, a portfolio that expanded to include water resources in September 2015. He was elected to the party leadership unopposed when Warren Truss stepped aside in February 2016, and thus to the deputy prime ministership.</p>
			<p>In December 2017 he became the first of six MPs to face by-elections arising from the Section 44 crisis, when it emerged he held dual New Zealand citizenship by descent through his father. Joyce achieved a morale-boosting win, but it was followed two months later by the revelation he had separated from his wife and was expecting a child with a former staffer, Vikki Campion, prompting his resignation from the party leadership and cabinet.</p>
			<p>Joyce returned to the leadership in June 2021 after winning a party room vote over his successor, Michael McCormack, reportedly by twelve votes to nine. This followed a failed attempt to move a spill motion in February 2020. With McCormack moving to the back bench after his defeat, Joyce also took over his portfolios of infrastructure, transport and regional development.

Her closest shave came in 2013, when the margin was reduced to 0.6%.</p>
			<p>Parramatta was much larger and at least partly semi-rural in character until the post-war development boom, in which time Labor's only win was with the election of Jim Scullin's government in 1929. Its conservative members included Joseph Cook (1901-1921), Liberal Prime Minister from June 1913 to September 1914; Sir Garfield Barwick (1958-1964), External Affairs Minister and Attorney-General in the Menzies government, and later Chief Justice of the High Court; and Philip Ruddock (1973-1977), who won a by-election with a 7.0% swing in his favour in September 1973.</p>
			<p>A watershed arrived when the 1977 redistribution effectively changed the existing seat's name to Dundas, of which Ruddock became the inaugural member, while Parramatta was made to extend deep into Sydney's Labor-voting west. Parramatta was then held for Labor by Hawke government minister John Brown until 1990, followed by Paul Elliott until 1996.</p>
			<p>Redistributions in 1984 and 1993 (the latter of which abolished Dundas) returned the seat to the marginal zone, helping Ross Cameron gain the seat for the Liberals in 1996. Today a right-wing media commentator who has aligned himself with the Liberal Democrats, Cameron was one of only three Coalition members to lose their seats at the 2004 election, which came shortly after he was compelled to reveal he had committed numerous infidelities through his married life.</p>

			<p>The electorate extends from the Parramatta town centre to Granville in the south, Wentworthville in the west, Carlingford in the north and Rydalmere in the east. It has the nation's highest migrant population and its fourth highest share of non-English speakers, being home to large populations of Chinese around Carlingford, Lebanese around Granville and Indians in Parramatta itself. It had the nation's sixth highest no vote in the same-sex marriage survey of late 2017, at 61.6%.</p>

			<p>Labor's new candidate is <b>Andrew Charlton</b>, managing director of technology company Accenture and former economics adviser to Kevin Rudd during his prime ministership. Charlton was reportedly one of several candidates approached by a Labor hierarchy intent on securing a high-profile candidate, along with former state Granville MP David Borger and Sydney barrister Cameron Murphy.</p>
			<p>Charlton's preselection was rubber-stamped by the party's national executive, circumventing a rank-and-file ballot that would have been contested by three candidates of Indian background, and thus representative of a demographic with a strong presence in the electorate: Durga Owen, a former staffer to Owens, Alan Mascarenhas, a former Sydney Morning Herald journalist, and Abha Devasia, a Left-aligned lawyer. Julie Owens was among the critics of the move to exclude them in favour of Charlton, who lives in Bellevue Hill in the eastern suburbs.</p>
			<p>The Liberal candidate is <b>Maria Kovacic</b>, Franchise Council of Australia director and former owner of an ANZ franchise, who was among those chosen by a committee consisting of Scott Morrison, Dominic Perrottet and former party president Christine McDiven that the party's national executive empowered to resolve outstanding preselections in March. Others who had nominated were Charles Camenzuli, engineer and unsuccessful candidate for the seat in 2010 and 2019. Camenzuli is the brother of Matt Camenzuli, who pursued the national executive's preselection interevention all the way to the High Court.</p>

			<p>Hunter region seat that was radically changed by the redistribution before the 2016 election, which together with an emphatic 10.5% swing helped Meryl Swanson gain it for Labor for the first time since 2001. This was followed by a 5.7% swing back to the Liberals in 2019 as part of the regional backlash that was most clearly felt in neighbouring Hunter. The seat has been a focus of One Nation's efforts, being the only seat outside Queensland contested by them in both 2016 and 2019, when they respectively polled 13.0% and 14.2%.</p>
			<p>Paterson was created in its current form in 1993, reviving a name that had been in use from 1949 and 1984 for an electorate that ran westwards from Maitland to Muswellbrook and Scone. That seat was held by the Liberals until 1969 and the National/Country Party thereafter, but the new seat had a more easterly and urban orientation, and was won for Labor in 1993 by Bob Horne. It then went back and forth between Horne and Liberal rival Bob Baldwin, the latter prevailing in 1996 and 2001 and the former doing so in 1998. Swings and redistributions increased Baldwin's margin to 6.3% going into the 2007 election, enough to sustain him through a 4.8% swing to Labor.</p>
			<p>Baldwin's double-digit margin from the 2013 election was eliminated when the Newcastle seat of Charlton was abolished at the 2016 election, and Paterson was drawn into the city's northern outskirts. It was reported that he was contemplating challenging David Gillespie as an independent in Lyne, which had absorbed much of Paterson's territory, but he declared himself &#8220;completely loyal&#8221; to the Liberal Party and instead opted to retire.</p>

		<background>
			<p>Inner western Sydney seat that was gained by the Liberals in 2013 for the first time since its creation in 1922, and retained by them in 2016 and 2019. Current member Fiona Martin prevailed on the latter occasion after the retirement of Craig Laundy, surviving a 1.5% swing to Labor. The seat was transformed at the 2010 election by the abolition of its eastern neighbour Lowe, from which it absorbed around 70% of its voters, cutting 6.0% from its then Labor margin.</p>
			<p>Reid was held for Labor by Whitlam and Hawke government minister Tom Uren from 1958 to 1990, and then by Left faction potentate Laurie Ferguson until 2010. Meanwhile, Lowe was held consistently but precariously for the Liberals by Billy McMahon, the Prime Minister from March 1971 to December 1972, from its creation in 1949 to 1982. Michael Maher gained it for Labor at the by-election following McMahon's mid-term retirement in 1982, and it then changed hands with some frequency, with Bob Woods and Paul Zammit gaining it for the Liberals in 1987 and 1996 respectively, and Mary Easson and John Murphy doing so for Labor in 1993 and 1998.</p>
			<p>With the abolition of Lowe in 2010, Laurie Ferguson was accommodated in the south-western Sydney seat of Werriwa, while Reid went to John Murphy, who had held Lowe since 1998. The backlash against Labor in Sydney at the 2010 election reduced Murphy's notional margin of 10.8% to 2.7%, which was followed in 2013 by a second decisive swing of 3.5% to Liberal candidate Craig Laundy, heir to and former general manager of his father Arthur Laundy's Laundy Hotels group.</p>
			<p>Laundy received a 2.4% redistribution boost going into the 2016 election, at which he was one of only three Coalition candidates in New South Wales to achieve a favourable swing. This reflected a pattern of strong results for the Liberals in inner urban areas, where Malcolm Turnbull held particular appeal. Laundy himself was notably loyal to Turnbull, resigning from his junior ministry position after he was deposed in August 2018, and then from parliament altogether.</p>

			<p>The electorate was oriented around Bankstown further to the west from its creation in 1922 to 1969, with much of its current territory having progressively been accommodated by the abolished seats of Evans, Martin and Parkes. Reid and its eastern neighbour Lowe maintained fairly consistent boundaries from 1969, being respectively centred around Auburn and Burwood, through to their effective merger in 2010. The redistribution before the 2016 election further strengthened the Liberals by transferring the Lebanese community hub of Auburn to Blaxland in the east.</p>

			<p>Covering the north-eastern corner of New South Wales since federation, Richmond has developed over time from a rural National/Country Party seat into a semi-urbanised one with counter-cultural undercurrents, making it reasonably secure for Labor and unusually strong for the Greens. Justine Elliot has held the seat since narrowly gaining it for Labor in 2004, winning re-election five times on margins ranging from 3.0% in 2013 to 8.9% in 2007.</p>
			<p>Prior to the Labor ascendancy, Richmond was noted as a fiefdom of the Anthony family, being passed down from Larry Anthony Sr (1937 to 1957) to Doug Anthony (1957 to 1984) and, after a gap, Larry Anthony (1996 to 2001). Doug Anthony had a particularly notable career, serving as Nationals leader from 1971 through to his retirement, making him Deputy Prime Minister throughout the period of the Fraser government from 1975 to 1983.</p>
			<p>The watershed arrived when Nevill Newell won the seat for Labor in 1990 from the then Nationals leader, Charles Blunt, who succeeded Doug Anthony in Richmond in 1984. Contributing to this surprise result was the independent candidacy of anti-nuclear activist Helen Caldicott, which drew a rash of new enrolments from the Nimbin area.</p>
			<p>Larry Anthony failed to win the seat back for the Nationals on his first attempt in 1993, but romped in on his second attempt in 1996 with an 8.5% swing.

Although safe for the Nationals in recent decades, the seat was fairly marginal for most of its history, most recently being won by Labor in 1977.</p>
			<p>Riverina was held for Labor from 1969 to 1974 by Al Grassby, a former state member for Murrumbidgee who had strong support from the Italian community that dominated Griffith and its surrounds. Grassby served as Immigration Minister in the first term of the Whitlam government, but was defeated by John Sullivan of the Country Party in 1974 after what Labor speech-writer Graham Freudenberg reckoned to be a &#8220;virulent racist campaign&#8221;. The Liberal candidate was Donald Mackay, who disappeared in 1977 after treading on the toes of local drug trade interests.</p>
			<p>Labor recovered the seat in 1977 by 51 votes, aided by the addition of Broken Hill to the electorate. However, the long-term trend to the Nationals asserted itself when Noel Hicks gained the seat against the trend in 1980, and it became definitively safe for the Nationals when Broken Hill was transferred out in 1993. Hicks was succeeded on his retirement in 1998 by Kay Hull, who was in turn succeeded in 2010 by McCormack.</p>

			<p>Robertson was mostly in conservative hands from 1913 to 1969, outside of a Labor interruption from 1943 to 1949. However, Labor gained an ascendancy as urban development caused it to shed its rural territory, starting with the election of Barry Cohen in 1969. Cohen retained the seat through Labor's twin disasters of 1975 and 1977 and went on to serve as a minister in the first two terms of the Hawke government. He retired in 1990, after which the seat was held for Labor for another two terms by Frank Walker.</p>
			<p>Walker was unseated in 1996 by Liberal candidate Jim Lloyd after a 9.1% swing, securing a 3.6% margin that increased to 7.0% in 2001 and 6.8% in 2004. However, this proved insufficient against the Labor tide of 2007, when he was defeated by 184 votes after a 7.1% swing. The seat was then held for one tumultuous term by Belinda Neal, a former Senator and the wife of Right faction powerbroker John Della Bosca.</p>
			<p>Neal was defeated for preselection at the 2010 election by Deborah O'Neill, who defied expectations by retaining the seat for Labor with a slight positive swing.

Billy Hughes held West Sydney for the first seventeen years of its existence, but felt compelled to find a new berth in Bendigo after he and his supporters split from Labor in 1917.</p>

			<p>Manly-based seat that was the scene of one of the most notable results of the 2019 election, when independent Zali Steggall unseated former Prime Minister Tony Abbott. Steggall outpolled Abbott 43.5% to 39.0% on the primary vote, setting up a 12.6% winning margin off strong flows of Labor and Greens preferences. Less widely noted was a 9.0% swing to Labor on the Liberal-versus-Labor two-party preferred measure, the biggest of the election. This resulted in a Liberal margin of 2.1% on a measure that had never previously been significantly lower than 10%.</p>
			<p>Warringah was created in 1922 and held consistently by various stripes of conservative up to the creation of the Liberal Party in 1944. The only time Liberal control slackened from then until 2019 came in 1969, when one-term member Edward St John resigned from the party after raising concerns in parliament about then Prime Minister John Gorton's indiscreet conduct with a female journalist. St John ran as an independent at the election that October, but managed only 20.6% against 50.2% for Liberal candidate Michael Mackellar.</p>
			<p>Mackellar went on to serve as senior minister in the Fraser government, before resigning in 1982 over his failure to declare a television set to customs. His retirement from parliament in 1994 initiated the by-election that brought Tony Abbott to parliament. Abbott first encountered trouble from an independent in 2001 when Peter Macdonald, who had held the state seat of Manly from 1991 to 1999, fell 5.7% short after preferences. Another independent, television presenter James Mathison, contributed to a 9.2% drop in Abbott's primary vote in 2016 by polling 11.4%, and his preferences helped the Greens reach the final count ahead of Labor.</p>

			<p>It had initially been hoped the seat would be contested by Gladys Berejiklian, whom internal polling reportedly showed to be uniquely placed to defeat Steggall, despite her entanglements with the Independent Commission Against Corruption. As it became apparent Berejiklian was uninterested, the focus turned to moderate-aligned barrister Jane Buncle, but she withdrew her nomination in late January.

			<p>Southern Sydney seat that has been held by Labor since its creation in 1993, most recently by senior front-bencher Tony Burke since 2004. The electorate was created in place of abolished St George, which took the unofficial name for the Hurstville, Rockdale and Kogarah area that now forms the southern end of Barton. St George changed hands many times through its existence from 1949 to 1993, but the balance tipped to Labor from the 1980s as the area became increasingly multicultural.</p>
			<p>The 1993 election coincided with the retirement of St George MP Stephen Dubois, allowing Grayndler MP Leo McLeay to be accommodated in Watson while making his existing seat available to Jeannette McHugh, whose Bondi-area seat of Phillip had been abolished. McLeay was succeeded on his retirement in 2004 by Tony Burke, who has held the seat on margins ranging from 6.8% in 2007 to 20.3% in 2013.</p>

			<p>Watson covers inner suburban territory roughly 15 kilometres south-west of central Sydney, from Strathfield and Burwood Heights at the city end to Punchbowl and Lakemba further afield. It has the nation's third highest proportion of non-English speakers, largely due to the Lebanese community around Punchbowl, and was the second most resistant to same-sex marriage in the 2017 survey, with a no vote of 69.9%. Redistributions in 2010 and 2016 strengthened Labor by pushing the electorate substantially northwards, adding Lakemba and Greenacre and removing Earlwood and most of Kingsgrove, which are now in Barton.</p>

			<p>Labor member <b>Tony Burke</b> is a former organiser with the Right faction Shop Distributive and Allied Employees Association, with which he had remained associated through his parliamentary career. This began with his election to the New South Wales Legislative Council in 2003, followed by his move to Watson a year later. He was swiftly promoted to shadow cabinet in 2005, going on to serve as Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Minister in the Rudd-Gillard government's first term, and as Sustainability, Environment, Water, Populations and Communities Minister in its second.</p>
			<p>Burke was a resolute supporter of Julia Gillard's leadership, and spoke publicly of the &#8220;chaos&#8221; of Kevin Rudd's first prime ministership during his unsuccessful comeback attempt in February 2012. Rudd nonetheless refused to accept Burke's resignation after the success of his leadership challenge in June 2013, instead persuading him to accept the challenging immigration, multicultural affairs and citizenship portfolio. Burke has remained a senior figure in shadow cabinet since 2013, serving in finance during Labor's first term in opposition, environment during its second, and industrial relations during its third.</p>

		<background>
			<p>Prestigious but increasingly precarious Liberal seat that has covered the Sydney Harbour shore east of the city and part of the coast since federation. It was briefly lost to the party when independent Kerryn Phelps won the by-election to replace Malcolm Turnbull in October 2018, then recovered at the May 2019 federal election by Dave Sharma, who had also been the Liberal candidate at the by-election.</p>
			<p>Phelps won the seat on the earlier occasion after polling 29.2% of the primary vote out of a field of 16 candidates, chasing down Sharma's 43.1% primary vote after preferences by a margin of 1.2%. Both were up on the primary vote amid a less crowded field the following May, Phelps to 32.4% and Sharma to 47.4%, with a slightly stronger flow of preferences tipping the balance in Sharma's favour. However, the Liberal vote was down 14.8% compared with Turnbull's result in 2019, and there was a 7.9% swing to Labor on the two-party preferred measure.</p>
			<p>Phelps' by-election win was only the second time the seat had not been won by the prevailing anti-Labor party of the day, the other being when Walter Marks retained it as an independent in 1929 after voting to bring down Stanley Bruce's government and losing Nationalist Party endorsement. Other notable members have included Robert Ellicott (1974-1981), who as Shadow Attorney-General played a crucial tactical role in the 1975 supply crisis; Peter Coleman (1981-1987), conservative intellectual and father-in-law of Peter Costello; and John Hewson (1987-1996), Opposition Leader from 1990 to 1994.</p>
			<p>Turnbull came to the seat in 2004 after winning a Liberal preselection vote against Peter King by 88 votes to 70, having gained the upper hand in a vigorous local party recruitment war. Sympathy for King was tempered by the fact that he himself gained the seat three years earlier in a preselection coup against Andrew Thomson, who succeeded Hewson in 1996. King ran as an independent but managed only third place, although his campaign may have contributed to a 2.4% Labor swing that reduced the margin to 5.5%. This was further cut to 2.5% by a redistribution, but Turnbull built up an enviable personal vote thereafter, sealed with an 11.0% swing in 2010.</p>

The electorate is the nation's wealthiest, and contains its largest Jewish population and fifth highest concentration of same-sex couples. The harbourside suburbs of Vaucluse, Point Piper and Darling Point are proverbial for their wealth, and have historically overwhelmed Labor's relative strength near the city and in the south. The electorate recorded an 80.8% yes vote in the 2017 same-sex marriage survey, the fourth highest in the country.</p>

		<background>
			<p>Outer south-western Sydney seat that has been held by Labor since 1934, most notably by Gough Whitlam, who held it through a parliamentary career lasting from 1952 to 1978, and later by Mark Latham from 1994 to 2005. Labor has tended to weaken over the time, with the margin reaching an historic low of 2.2% in 2013 before a redistribution shored it up by 3.7%. It has been held since the 2016 election by Anne Stanley, who picked up a 1.7% swing on debut followed by a 2.7% swing back to the Liberals in 2019.</p>
			<p>Werriwa was a rural electorate when created at federation, and did not become safe for Labor until it was drawn into the fringe of Sydney and, initially, the Illawarra in 1934. Hubert Lazzarini held the seat for Labor from 1919 until his death in 1952, except when the Country Party held it for a term after the 1931 landslide. Gough Whitlam succeeded Lazzarini and held the seat through to his retirement in the wake of the 1977 election defeat.</p>
			<p>The seat was then held by John Kerin, a Hawke-Keating government minister who had a forgettable stint as Treasurer after Paul Keating's failed first leadership challenge in June 1991, followed by Mark Latham, who succeeded Kerin following his mid-term retirement in 1994 and led the party from December 2003 to January 2005, a period encompassing Labor's fourth successive election defeat in October 2004. Latham retired from parliament in January 2005, later to return as a One Nation member of the state Legislative Council in 2019.</p>
			<p>Latham's successor was Chris Hayes, who moved to the seat of Fowler in 2010 as part of a complex deal reached after the abolition of the Labor-held seat of Lowe in Sydney's inner west. The member for Lowe, John Murphy, was allocated to the seat of Reid, which had effectively been merged with Lowe, and Werriwa went to Laurie Ferguson, who had held Reid since 1990. Anne Stanley came to the seat upon Ferguson's retirement in 2016.</p>

			<p>Werriwa is centred around the interchange that connects the Westlink and the South Western Motorway 30 kilometres west of Sydney, encompassing Green Valley and Hinchinbrook in the north, Prestons in the centre and Macquarie Fields in the south. The electorate has the nation's sixth highest Lebanese and Turkish population, and in common with such areas produced a high no vote in the late 2017 same-sex marriage survey, of 63.7%. The seat was substantially changed to Labor's advantage at the redistribution before the 2016 election, which added the northern end of the electorate and transferred the Minto area in the south to Macarthur.</p>

The Liberals elected to leave the seat to the Nationals in 2019, despite the party's weak presence in the area, but have returned to the field at this election.</p>
			<p>Throsby was created in 1984 out of territory previously covered by Cunningham and Macarthur, and was successively held for Labor by Colin Hollis, who gained Macarthur for Labor at the 1983 election; Jennie George, a former president of the Australian Council of Trade Unions who succeeded Hollis in 2001; and Stephen Jones, who succeeded George in 2010 and carried over to Whitlam in 2016.</p>

			<p>Throsby covers the coastal urban territory around Shellharbour, Dapto and its surrounds on the northern shore Lake Illawarra, and the Southern Highlands towns of Bowral, Moss Vale and Mittagong. The latter area votes conservative, but is outweighed by Labor's strength in the more populous Illawarra region. The Labor margin was boosted when the Southern Highlands was transferred out of the electorate in 1993, being first split between Macarthur and Gilmore and then transferred to Hume from 2007 to 2010, then cut by 6.7% when it was restored in 2010.</p>

			<p>Covering the Northern Territory outside Darwin since the territory was divided into two electorates in 2001, Lingiari has been held for Labor since its creation in 2001 by Warren Snowdon, who will retire at the coming election. Snowdon previously held the single Northern Territory electorate that preceded Lingiari and Solomon from 1987 to 2001, outside of the term from 1996 to 1998 when it fell to the Country Liberal Party.</p>
			<p>The Northern Territory first gained a seat in the House of Representatives 1922, but its member did not attain full voting rights until 1968. The seat had recently fallen to Sam Calder of the Country Party after a long period of Labor control. Calder retained the seat until his retirement in 1980, his party status changing from Country Party to Country Liberal Party when the latter was established in 1978. It thereafter changed hands with some regularity, being won by Labor in 1983, 1987, 1990, 1993 and 1998, and by the CLP in 1980, 1984 and 1996.</p>
			<p>Labor's hold on has been largely underwritten by the indigenous vote, although the pattern was disturbed to some extent in 2010 when Alice Springs swung strongly to Labor while the remote mobile booths swung fully 28.1% the other way. The latter result was attributed to the Labor government's retention of the Howard government's intervention measures in 2007, a troubled indigenous housing program and the actions of newly merged regional councils.</p>
			<p>The 2.8% swing that brought Warren Snowdon to the brink of defeat in 2013 was not evident in the remote area booths, which swung slightly to Labor. Snowdon then returned to a solid footing with a 7.5% swing in 2016, followed by a 2.7% swing back to the Country Liberal Party in 2019. The CLP candidate on the latter occasion was Jacinta Price, who is running at the coming election as the party's lead Senate candidate.</p>

			<p>Lingiari covers almost the entire Northern Territory land mass, making it the second largest electorate geographically after Durack in Western Australia. For the second time, the parliament has legislated in the past term to preserve the Northern Territory's two seats after its population fell below the required threshold, the first such occasion being before the 2004 election. As a result, the electorates have the lowest enrolments in the country of around 70,000, compared with a national average of around 110,000.</p>
			<p>The electorate's biggest population centre is Alice Springs, followed by Katherine and Tennant Creek, but much of its population is drawn from the remote communities that make it the country's most heavily indigenous electorate. This status is sadly reflected in its age profile, ranking last in the country for persons aged over 70.</p>

She has more recently been chief executive of the Northern Land Council.</p>

			<p>The Northern Territory first gained a seat in 1922, but its member did not attain full voting rights until 1968.

			<p>Solomon had a notional CLP margin of 2.3% on its creation in 2001, prompting Warren Snowdon, the Labor member for Northern Territory, to favour the safer option of Lingiari. It was contested for the CLP by David Tollner, who survived a 2.2% swing to Labor to prevail by 88 votes. Tollner added 2.7% to his margin in 2004, before Damien Hale narrowly gained it for Labor in 2007 with a 3.0% swing, the margin this time being 196 votes. Tollner went on to a tumultuous career in the Northern Territory parliament from 2008 to 2016.</p>
			<p>Hale lasted only one term before being unseated in 2010 by CLP candidate Natasha Griggs, who accounted for Hale's tiny margin with a swing of 1.9%. Luke Gosling made his first run as Labor candidate in 2013, and while he did well to gain a 0.3% swing against the national trend, it was insufficient to account for Griggs' margin.</p>
			<p>The ongoing district of the territory into Solomon and Lingiari has twice required parliamentary intervention after its population fell slightly below the required threshold, first ahead of the 2004 election and again last year. As a result, the electorates have the lowest enrolments in the country of around 70,000, compared with a national average of around 110,000.</p>

It has a less multicultural complexion than Darwin and a high proportion of mortgage-paying families, and is the strongest area for the Country Liberal Party.</p>
			<p>The electorate's distinguishing demographic characteristics are the country's ninth highest proportion of indigenous persons, a large concentration of persons in their twenties and thirties, and a correspondingly low number of persons over 65.

			<p>Covering Ipswich and rural territory to the north, Blair is one of six seats created to accommodate Queensland's population growth between 1993 and 2010. It has been held for Labor since 2007 by Shayne Neumann, one of two survivors of Labor's nine-seat haul in Queensland in 2007, along with Graham Perrett in Moreton. Neumann suffered his closest scrape amid the anti-Labor backlash in Queensland in 2019, surviving a 6.9% swing by 1.2%.</p>
			<p>Blair became an instant flashpoint of the 1998 election when it was created from territory that had mostly been in Oxley, where Pauline Hanson sensationally swept to victory in 1996. With her home turf now divided between two electorates, Hanson turned down the certainty of a Senate seat to chance her arm in Blair. While she outpolled Liberal candidate Cameron Thompson by 36.0% to 21.7% on the primary vote, Labor and Nationals preferences allowed Thompson to prevail by 3.4%. Thompson had finished narrowly ahead of Labor at the second last count, but for which the result would have tested the impact of the Liberals' and Nationals' decision to put Hanson last on preferences.</p>
			<p>Thompson appeared to absorb most of the disappearing One Nation vote in 2001, but it was unable to sustain him against a 10.2% swing to Labor amid Kevin Rudd's sweep through Queensland in 2007. Shayne Neumann went on to score a series of above-par electoral performances, including a swing against the trend of the 2013 election, before a 6.9% reversal in 2019 that exceeded a statewide swing of 4.3%.</p>

			<p>The seat of Brisbane has mostly been in Labor hands since the Second World War, but the Liberal National Party has been ascendant since 2010 due to favourable boundaries and Labor's generally low ebb in Queensland. The member since 2016 has been Trevor Evans, who recorded a mild favourable swing in 2016 followed by a mild unfavourable one in 2019. The latter result made it one of only three Queensland seats to swing to Labor in 2019, a dynamic reflected in inner urban areas across the country.</p>
			<p>Brisbane vies with Griffith for the title of strongest seat in Queensland for the Greens, with Griffith having a slight edge in 2019.

			<p>The electorate's demographic indicators are typical for an inner-city seat, albeit that it is less multicultural than the Sydney and Melbourne electorates. It boasts the highest median income in Queensland, a heavy concentration of persons in their twenties and thirties, and correspondingly few children and seniors. Its 79.5% yes vote in the late 2017 same-sex marriage referendum was the sixth highest in the country, and the highest outside Sydney and Melbourne.</p>

			<p>Encompassing Rockhampton and surrounding Central Queensland territory, Capricornia is once strong Labor seat that has been held for the Liberal National Party since 2013 by Michelle Landry. Landry achieved a breakthrough result with an 11.7% swing in 2019, the most spectacular manifestation of a backlash against Labor across regional Queensland. She had previously gained the seat by a narrow margin up on the election of the Abbott government and the retirement of Labor incumbent Kirsten Livermore in 2013, and survived a second close result in 2016.</p>
			<p>Between 1961 and 2016, Labor's only defeats in Capricornia coincided with the demise of the Whitlam, Keating and Rudd governments in 1975, 1996 and 2013. Kirsten Livermore's closest shave after recovering the seat for Labor in 1998 came when Michelle Landry first ran in 2010, reducing Livermore's 12.7% margin after the Labor blowout of 2007 to 3.7%.</p>

			<p>Capricornia extends from Rockhampton north to the southern outskirts of Mackay, and west through farming and coal mining communities as far as Belyando 250 kilometres inland. Rockhampton has been its mainstay since it was created at federation (although the city was divided between Capricornia and Dawson from 1969 to 1984), as well as Labor's main source of strength. Income levels are similar to the typically more conservative neighbouring seats of Dawson and Flynn, with the size of the mining workforce accounting for Labor's relative strength.</p>

			<p>Labor's only wins in Dawson since its creation in 1949 came when Whitlam government minister Rex Patterson held the seat from 1966 to 1975, and when James Bidgood gained it amid Labor's nine-seat haul in Queensland in 2007. Patterson gained the seat at a by-election in February 1966 and did remarkably well to retain it amid Labor's poor result at the general election the following November. He was unseated in the 1975 landslide by Ray Braithwaite, who retained it for the Nationals on generally narrow margins through to 1996, the closest being 181 votes in 1990.</p>
			<p>Braithwaite was succeeded by De-Anne Kelly, who built up a 10.4% margin in 2004 only to be swept out by a 13.2% swing in 2007. One-term Labor member James Bidgood became noted chiefly for his eccentric views on the origins of the global financial crisis, and bowed out at the 2010 election citing ill health. George Christensen then gained the seat with a 5.0% swing, followed by further favourable swings of 5.1% in 2013 and 11.2% in 2019, interrupted by a 4.2% shift back to Labor in 2016.</p>

		<background>
			<p>Northern Brisbane seat held on modest margins since 2001 by one-time prime ministerial aspirant Peter Dutton. The seat had previously been in Labor hands for two of its three terms since 1993, when it was the first of six new seats created to accommodate Queensland's population explosion over two decades.</p>
			<p>The inaugural member for Dickson was Michael Lavarch, who moved to the new seat after it absorbed much of the territory of his existing seat of Fisher, which he had held for Labor since 1987. Lavarch went on to serve as Attorney-General in the final term of the Keating government, before falling victim to Labor's near-wipeout in Queensland in 1996.</p>
			<p>The seat was then held for the Liberals for a term by Tony Smith (not to be confused with the later member for the Victorian seat of Casey), whose career would shortly implode when police questioned him after he was seen leaving a building that housed a brothel. Smith forestalled preselection defeat by quitting the Liberal Party, and managed 9.0% as an independent in 1998.</p>
			<p>Meanwhile, Labor had pulled off an apparent coup in recruiting former Australian Democrats leader Cheryl Kernot, but her performance at the 1998 election fell short of expectations. Kernot had harsh words for the Labor organisation as she appeared to be staring down the barrel of defeat on election night, though she in fact went on to win by 276 votes. Her experience as a Labor MP proved brief and unhappy, and she was soundly defeated in 2001 by Peter Dutton.</p>
			<p>After a comfortable re-election in 2004, Dutton was brought within 217 votes of defeat amid Kevin Rudd's sweep through Queensland in 2007, when the swing in Dickson was 8.8%. What remained of his margin was then eliminated by a redistribution, inspiring an unsuccessful preselection bid in the safe Gold Coast seat of McPherson. However, Dutton turned out to have less to fear in Dickson than he may have calculated, and he easily retained the seat with a 5.9% swing in 2010.</p>
			<p>Dickson's precariousness reasserted at the 2016 election, when a 5.1% swing reduced Dutton's margin to 1.6%. The pendulum then swung 2.8% back to Dutton amid the Coalition's unexpectedly strong performance in Queensland in 2019.</p>

			<p>Prior to entering politics in 2001, <b>Peter Dutton</b> was a police officer who worked in the Queensland Police drugs and sex offenders squads, and later with the National Crime Authority. He served in the outer ministry in the final term of the Howard government from 2004 to 2007, then in shadow cabinet after the 2007 election defeat.</p>
			<p>With his already precarious position in Dickson undermined by a redistribution, and the Rudd government appearing in the ascendant, Dutton sought a lifeline in 2009 in the safe Gold Coast seat of McPherson. However, locals who had long hoped to succeed retiring member Margaret May were not of a mind to accommodate him, despite Dutton raising the stakes by declaring he would not fall back on Dickson if he failed. He reneged on this commitment after losing the preselection to local favourite Karen Andrews, which did nothing to prevent his comfortable re-election in 2010.</p>
			<p>Dutton served as Health Minister from the election of the Abbott government in 2013 to December 2014, when he was reassigned to immigration and border protection. He retained the position after Malcolm Turnbull deposed Tony Abbott in September 2015, despite being one of only a handful of Queensland Liberals who had supported Abbott. His responsibilities were expanded with the new home affairs portfolio in December 2017, combining responsibility for national security, law enforcement and immigration, in an ultimately vain bid by Turnbull to mollify the right. He exchanged the portfolio for defence in the March 2021 reshuffle.</p>
			<p>Dutton launched an unsuccessful bid for the leadership amid a rebellion over energy policy in August 2018, losing a party ballot against Malcolm Turnbull by 48 votes to 35. The Dutton camp agitated for another vote, which Turnbull refused to offer unless a majority of the party room signed a petition demanding one. Dutton's supporters achieved this only with difficulty, by which time Scott Morrison's supporters had secured support from the Turnbull camp and a critical mass of waverers. With Turnbull deciding not to contest, Morrison prevailed over Dutton in a second vote by 45 votes to 40.</p>

			<p>Gold Coast seat that has drifted from Brisbane's outer south since its creation in 1977, becoming safe for the conservatives in the process. It has been held for the Liberals and the Liberal National Party since 2007 by Morrison government minister Stuart Robert, whose margins have never fallen below double digits. The Nationals were never seriously competitive in the seat, polling 7.4% when they last fielded a candidate in 2007.</p>
			<p>Labor's only win in Fadden came when David Beddall unseated Liberal member Don Cameron upon the election of the Hawke government in 1983, at which time it covered none of its current territory. Cameron had previously held Griffith from 1966 to 1977, and would later hold Moreton from a November 1983 by-election until 1990. Beddall moved to Rankin when it was created with the enlargement of parliament in 1984, and Fadden was recovered for the Liberals by David Jull, who held it through to 2007.</p>

			<p>The electorate first became recognisable as the one that exists today in 1993, when the growing population of the Gold Coast could no longer be contained by Moncrieff and McPherson.

			<p>Sunshine Coast seat that was famously won by Clive Palmer in 2013, before reverting to type when Ted O'Brien won it for the Liberal National Party on his second attempt in 2016. Palmer defeated O'Brien by 53 votes in 2013 after a massive advertising campaign and a counting process blighted by his own obstructiveness, with scrutineers challenging more than half the votes during a recount. He did not recontest the seat in 2016, his stocks having declined amid the resignation of two of the three Senators elected for his Palmer United Party and the collapse of his Townsville-based Queensland Nickel company.</p>
			<p>Fairfax was created with the expansion of parliament in 1984 and won for the Nationals on its inauguration by Evan Adermann, part of a father-and-son dynasty that had held the seat of Fisher since 1949. With Adermann's retirement in 1990, former Treasury secretary John Stone contested the seat for the Nationals in what proved an ill-timed attempt to switch from the Senate, coming at the party's low ebb in the wake of the Fitzgerald inquiry. It was instead won for the Liberals by Alex Somlyay, who overcame Stone's narrow lead on the primary vote with Australian Democrats preferences.</p>
			<p>Somlyay retained the seat through to 2013, his closest run being a 3.0% margin amid Labor's high tide in Queensland in 2007. The Nationals ran against Somlyay in 1993 and 1998, but encountered diminishing returns. Somlyay's retirement in 2013 set the scene for Palmer's successful run, after which Ted O'Brien secured a 10.9% margin over Labor in the more settled circumstances of 2016, followed by a further 2.6% swing in 2019.</p>

		<background>
			<p>Sunshine Coast seat that has been in conservative hands for all but two terms since its creation in 1949. The seat was notable in its recent history for the conflict between Peter Slipper, who quit the Liberal National Party in 2015 to accept the minority Labor government's offer of the Speakership, and Mal Brough, who succeeded him as member in 2013. Brough's tenure proved unexpectedly brief, and he was succeeded in 2016 by the current member, Andrew Wallace.</p>
			<p>Fisher was held for the National/Country Party from 1949 to 1972 by Charles Adermann, and then from 1972 to 1984 by his son, Evan Adermann. The younger Adermann moved to the new seat of Fairfax in 1984, and Fisher was won for the Nationals by Peter Slipper. Slipper became an ardent proponent of the Joh-for-PM push that reduced the Coalition to disarray in early 1987, and lost the seat to Labor's Michael Lavarch at the election that followed.</p>
			<p>Lavarch moved to the new seat of Dickson in 1993 after it absorbed the northern Brisbane areas that had made Labor competitive in Fisher, providing Slipper with a comeback opportunity, this time as a Liberal. Slipper's star was clearly in the descendant by the time the Howard government lost office, and it soon became apparent that Howard government Mal Brough hoped to use the seat for a comeback after losing his seat of Longman in 2007. However, Brough's plans for 2010 were thwarted when all sitting members were guaranteed endorsement under the terms of the Liberal National Party merger, which caused Brough to resign as Liberal state president.</p>
			<p>Labor identified Slipper as a Coalition weak link as it battled to survive in minority government after the 2010 election, and succeeded in electing him Deputy Speaker ahead of the Coalition nominee, Maranoa MP Bruce Scott. The government went one better when it persuaded Slipper to become Speaker in November 2011, improving its position on the floor and prompting Slipper's expulsion from the party. However, he only lasted in the role only until the following May, when one of his staffers, James Ashby, accused him of sexual harassment and presented evidence of misuse of Cabcharge vouchers. Ashby later emerged as an influential adviser to Pauline Hanson.</p>
			<p>Slipper's troubles also embroiled Mal Brough, who initially dismissed suggestions he knew of Ashby's actions before conceding he had sought legal advice on his behalf. This did not prevent him winning preselection in Fisher against surprise late entrant James McGrath, a rising star in the party who instead found a berth in the Senate. Brough was promoted to cabinet after backing Malcolm Turnbull's successful leadership challenge in September 2015, but stood down a month later amid a police investigation into his role in procuring Slipper's diary via Ashby, then quit politics altogether at the 2016 election.</p>

			<p>Chris Trevor ran for Labor for a third time in 2013, but O'Dowd was returned with a swing in his favour of 3.0%. This gave him enough fat to survive a 5.5% swing to Labor in 2016 by 1.0%, before the tide across regional Queensland in 2019 inflated his margin to a new peak of 8.7%.</p>

He then survived a 3.8% swing by 0.6% in 2016 before riding the Queensland anti-Labor wave with an 8.0% swing in 2019.</p>
			<p>Forde was created in name with the enlargement of parliament in 1984, but was at that time located further north. David Watson won the seat for the Liberals on its inauguration by 43 votes, a margin he was unable to defend in 1987. He would later pursue a career in state politics, leading the Liberal Party to its disastrous result in 2001.</p>
			<p>Mary Crawford held Forde for Labor from 1987 until 1996, when she was scuttled by an unfavourable redistribution and the party's refusal to grant her the safer seat of Rankin, partly due to its determination to accommodate Kevin Rudd in Griffith. Kay Elson gained the seat for the Liberals in 1996 with a 9.6% swing, and retained comfortable margins through to her retirement in 2007.</p>
			<p>With the loss of Elson's incumbency and the statewide sweep to Labor under Kevin Rudd, Forde was won in 2007 by Brett Raguse with a 14.4% swing, the biggest of the election.

			<p>Held from 1998 to 2014 by Kevin Rudd, Griffith has been in Labor hands for all but one term since 1977, the exception being after Rudd's failed first attempt in 1996. However, current member Terri Butler has held a precarious grip since succeeding Rudd at a by-election in 2014, at which she prevailed by 1.8%, followed by winning margins of 1.6% in 2016 and 2.9% in 2019.</p>
			<p>Griffith has existed in name since it was created in place of a seat called Oxley in 1934, a name that would later be revived for a new and unrelated seat around Ipswich in 1949. It has been highly marginal for much of its history, going back and forth between Labor and Liberal in 1949, 1954, 1958, 1961, 1966, 1977, 1996 and 1998. Don Cameron held the seat for the Liberals from 1966 to 1977, when an unfavourable redistribution caused him to move to the new seat of Fadden on the Gold Coast. Griffith was then held for Labor by Ben Humphreys through to his retirement in 1996.</p>
			<p>Kevin Rudd first contested the seat in 1996, having previously been a diplomat and a particularly powerful member of Premier Wayne Goss's staff from 1989 to 1996. However, he fell short amid Labor's statewide rout at that election, with Graeme McDougall gaining the seat for the Liberals with a 6.2% swing. Rudd had better luck amid the far more favourable environment of 1998, when he gained a 3.9% swing to prevail by 2.4%.</p>
			<p>Rudd established an impressive electoral record in gaining swings against the trend in 2001 and 2004, followed by a further swing when he led Labor to victory in 2007. The 3.9% swing in the aftermath of his ousting in 2010 was below the Queensland norm, but the mood appeared to have hardened when he contested the seat as Prime Minister at the 2013 election, when he suffered a 5.5% swing.</p>
			<p>The by-election held in February 2014 after Rudd's post-election retirement developed into a keenly fought contest between Terri Butler and Bill Glasson, a former Australian Medical Association president. With the collapse in support for the Abbott government after the 2014 budget still two months away, Butler fought off the challenge only with difficulty, surviving a 1.2% swing by 1.8%.</p>
			<p>Butler failed to consolidate in 2016, when the effect of a favourable redistribution was cancelled out by a 1.5% swing to the LNP. This was followed by a favourable swing of 1.4% in 2019, defying a statewide trend but typifying Labor's relatively strong performance in inner urban areas.</p>

	<district id="Groom" name="Groom">
		<background>
			<p>Dominated by Toowoomba, Groom has effectively existed since federation, taking into account a name change from Darling Downs in 1984, and has never been held by Labor. It was the scene of one of two by-elections held during the last term, with Garth Hamilton retaining the seat for the Liberal National Party in November 2020 against a modest 3.3% swing to Labor.</p>
			<p>The electorate takes its name from the first two members for Darling Downs, father William Groom and son Littleton Groom. The latter succeeded the former after he became the first federal parliamentarian to die in office in August 1901, and held the seat for all but one term through to his own death in 1936. He lost the seat after helping to bring down Stanley Bruce's government in 1929, resulting in his expulsion from the Nationalists, but recovered it as an independent in 1931 and joined the United Australia Party in 1933.</p>
			<p>Groom's death was followed by a by-election at which the seat was won for the Country Party by Arthur Fadden, later to serve as Prime Minister for six weeks in mid-1941. When the parliament was enlarged in 1949, an agreement between the Liberal and Country parties resulted in Fadden moving to the new seat of McPherson and Darling Downs being allocated to the Liberals. It was then held for the Liberals by Reginald Swartz through to his retirement in 1972, without opposition from the Country Party.</p>
			<p>The seat promptly returned to the Country Party when it was again free to contest it on Swartz's retirement in 1972, and was thereafter held until 1988 by Tom McVeigh, who easily overcame challenges from the Liberals in what was now the seat of Groom in 1984 and 1987. It was then won for the Liberals at the by-election following McVeigh's mid-term retirement by Bill Taylor.</p>
			<p>The seat was easily retained for the Liberals by Ian Macfarlane when Taylor retired in 1998, with the Nationals polling poorly both on that occasion and on their final attempt in 2001. After serving in cabinet from 2001 to 2007 and again when the Abbott government was elected in 2013, Macfarlane was relegated to the back bench when Malcolm Turnbull became Prime Minister in September 2015. He subsequently sought to jump ship from the Liberal party room to the Nationals, only for the move to be scotched by the state executive of the Liberal National Party.</p>
			<p>Macfarlane retired at the 2016 election and was succeeded by John McVeigh, son of Tom McVeigh and previously the state member for Toowoomba South since 2012. The November 2020 by-election was precipitated when McVeigh announced his retirement the previous September, citing his wife's illness.</p>

		<background>
			<p>Townsville-based seat that has experienced a number of narrow results over recent decades, with Labor's only win since 1993 being achieved by a 37-vote margin in 2016. The current Liberal National Party member, Phillip Thompson, easily accounted for the tiny Labor margin in 2019 with an 8.4% swing as part of the broader backlash against Labor in regional Queensland.</p>
			<p>Herbert has existed in name since federation, although it originally ran from Mackay to Cape York and did not become entirely dominated by Townsville since 1984. Labor held the seat more often than not until 1966, when Robert Bonnett gained it for the Liberals as part of Harold Holt's landslide and retained it through to his retirement in 1977. Bonnett picked up swings at each election he contested, including two against the national trend in 1969 and 1972.</p>
			<p>The seat returned to the marginal zone when Labor candidate Ted Lindsay cut the margin of Bonnett's successor, Gordon Dean, from 7.7% to 0.9% in 1980, before going one better with the election of the Hawke government in 1983. Lindsay retained the seat through to the Keating government's defeat in 1996, when he lost to unrelated Liberal candidate Peter Lindsay. He came within 160 votes of recovering it with a 6.5% swing in 1998, but the seat drifted back to the Liberals over the next two elections. Peter Lindsay held on by 343 votes against the statewide tide to Labor in 2007, and retired in 2010.</p>
			<p>Evan Jones then held the seat for the Liberal National Party for two terms, gaining swings of 2.2% in 2010 and 4.0% in 2013. His 6.2% buffer was fractionally shy of what he needed to hold out against the swing in 2016, when Cathy O'Toole won it for Labor by the barest of margins.</p>

			<p>Herbert covers Townsville outside of the area around Annandale and Wulguru south of the Ross River, which is in Dawson. Labor's strongest booths are generally in the town centre and its surrounds, with the outer suburbs tending to be both more volatile and more conservative. The electorate has the country's third largest defence workforce due to the presence of the Lavarack Barracks and an RAAF base. Relatedly, a concentration of people in their twenties gives the electorate the country's third lowest median age.</p>

	<district id="Hinkler" name="Hinkler">
		<background>
			<p>Based around Bundaberg, Hinkler has been held by the Nationals and the Liberal National Party for all but two terms since its creation in 1984. Labor's position has weakened over time due to the removal of Gladstone in 2007 and a general drift away from the party in regional Queensland. The member since 2013 has been Keith Pitt, who served in cabinet from February 2020 to June 2021, when he was demoted to the outer ministry upon Barnaby Joyce's return to the Nationals leadership.</p>
			<p>Hinkler was narrowly won for the Nationals on its creation in 1984 by Bryan Conquest, before a slight swing delivered it to Labor candidate Brian Courtice in 1987. Courtice increased his margin in 1990 but was unseated by 344 votes in 1993 after a 4.6% swing. He was later expelled from the ALP and appeared in Coalition advertising denouncing Kevin Rudd during the 2007 campaign.</p>
			<p>The seat was then held for the Nationals by Paul Neville, who had something of a charmed life in winning by 344 votes in 1993, 510 votes in 1998 and 64 votes in 2001, while enjoying favourable redistributions in 2004 and 2007. He gained an 8.9% swing in 2010, the third highest in the state, bequeathing a secure margin to Keith Pitt in 2013. One Nation polled 19.2% in 2016 and 14.8%, respectively their second and fifth best results out of the seats they contested.</p>
		</background>
		<profile>
			<p>Hinkler covers 90 kilometres of the central Queensland coast, encompassing Hervey Bay in the south and Bundaberg in the north, and extends inland to include Childers. Hervey Bay in particular is noted as a retirement haven, contributing to the country's third highest proportion of residents aged in their seventies. Its large population of pensioners is also reflected in it having the nation's lowest median income.</p>
			<p>The electorate underwent significant change when the new seat of Flynn was created in 2007, which absorbed the Labor-voting port city of Gladstone. The result was a more compact Hinkler concentrated around Bundaberg and Hervey Bay, the latter of which had been gained from the Wide Bay electorate. The Nationals thus gained what proved to be a decisive boost in their margin ahead of the tidal shift to Labor in Queensland under Kevin Rudd.</p>

			<p>Hinkler's Nationals-aligned member is <b>Keith Pitt</b>, a former electrical engineer, cane farmer and managing director of a workplace health and safety consultancy. Pitt was promoted to parliamentary secretary in February 2016 but was dropped at the instigation of Barnaby Joyce in December 2017, reportedly angering him to the extent that he considered quitting the party. He was restored to the position after Joyce was compelled to resign two months later, only to be demoted again when Scott Morrison became Prime Minister the following August.</p>
			<p>Pitt's fortunes briefly turned when he was elevated to cabinet in February 2020 to fill the vacancy created by Bridget McKenzie's resignation, taking on resources, water and northern Australia. However, he was again demoted after supporting Michael McCormack against Barnaby Joyce's successful leadership challenge in June 2021, this time to the outer ministry, while retaining the resources and water portfolios. Joyce reportedly wished to have Pitt relegated to the back bench, but Scott Morrison argued for his retention.</p>
			<p>Yet another reversal of fortune came in October 2021, when Pitt was granted cabinet status without charging his portfolio. This gave effect to the Nationals' demand for an extra seat in cabinet as a condition for agreeing to a net zero carbon emissions target by 2050, of which Pitt had been one of the most vocal critics.</p>

	<district id="Kennedy" name="Kennedy">
		<background>
			<p>Covering nearly a third of Queensland's area, the north Queensland seat of Kennedy has been held since 1993 by Bob Katter, first for the Nationals, then as an independent from 2001 to 2011, and thereafter as the sole federal representative of Katter's Australian Party. His father, Bob Katter Sr, held the seat for the National/Country Party from 1966 to 1990, his arrival marking a watershed between epochs of Labor and conservative domination.</p>
			<p>Kennedy was one of 16 seats won by Labor at the first federal election in 1901, and was retained by the party for all but two terms through to 1966. The interruption came when incumbent Charles McDonald died during the 1925 election campaign, resulting in Nationalist candidate Grosvenor Francis being elected unopposed. This prompted an amendment to the Electoral Act so that an election for a given seat would be postponed if a candidate died between the close of nominations and polling day. Francis retained the seat in 1928, but it returned to Labor when the Scullin government was elected the following year.</p>
			<p>Bob Katter Sr won the seat in 1966 off a national anti-Labor landslide and the retirement of Bill Riordan, who had held it for Labor since 1936. Katter dominated the seat through to his retirement in 1990, although the 1984 redistribution made his position more precarious. The loss of his personal vote when he retired in 1990 drove a decisive 4.4% swing to Labor's Rob Hulls, later to emerge as a senior Bracks-Brumby government minister in Victoria.</p>
			<p>Hulls was unable to hold out in 1993 against the younger Bob Katter, who had represented the local area in state parliament since 1974. Katter cemented his position with a double-digit swing in 1996, and his primary vote increased further after he quit the Nationals ahead of the 2001 election. He retained a secure hold on the seat through to 2013, although his efforts to expand his empire with Katter's Australian Party met with no success at federal level.</p>
			<p>Despite having parted company with fellow country independents Tony Windsor and Rob Oakeshott in backing the Coalition to form government after the indecisive 2010 election result, Katter appeared to suffer from the backlash against the Labor minority government in 2013, when his primary vote slumped from 46.7% to 29.4%. He nonetheless prevailed by 2.2% after preferences and bounced back in 2016, recording 39.9% on the primary vote and an 11.1% margin after preferences, which increased to 41.0% and 13.3% in 2019.</p>

			<p>Covering most of Cairns and the Cape York Peninsula, Leichhardt has been held for all but one term since 1996 by Warren Entsch, a Liberal-aligned member of the Liberal National Party. Entsch is seeking another term at the age of 71, having thought better of his announcement on the night of the 2019 election that the current term would be his last.</p>
			<p>Leichhardt was created with the enlargement of parliament in 1949 from territory that had mostly been in Herbert until 1934 and Kennedy thereafter. Herbert and then Kennedy were in Labor hands from 1928 to 1949, but the Country Party narrowly gained Leichhardt on its inauguration as the Coalition swept to power under Bob Menzies. Labor gained the seat at the next election in 1951, and it remained with them through to the debacle of 1975.</p>
			<p>The seat again changed hands with the next three changes of government, being held for Labor by John Gayler for the first four terms of the Hawke-Keating government and Peter Dodd for the fifth, and for the Liberals by Warren Entsch after John Howard came to power in 1996. Entsch went into a short-term retirement at the 2007 election, which together with the statewide trend helped Jim Turnour gain the seat for Labor with a 14.3% swing, just shaded by Forde in outer Brisbane as the biggest of the election.</p>
			<p>Entsch easily recovered the seat from Turnour on his return in 2010 with an 8.6% swing, and has since held it on margins of 5.7% in 2013, 4.0% in 2016 and 4.2% in 2019. In contrast to most of regional Queensland, the seat did not record a substantial swing against Labor in 2019.</p>

			<p>Leichhardt consists of the northernmost part of Queensland, including Cape York Peninsula and the Torres Strait Islands, with Cairns at its southern coastal extremity. Cairns is naturally marginal and provides about two-thirds of the voters, the remainder coming from conservative-leaning rural areas immediately north of Cairns and Labor-voting indigenous communities further afield. The electorate has the nation's third highest indigenous population, behind Lingiari in the Northern Territory and Durack in Western Australia.</p>

			<p><b>Warren Entsch</b> came to politics in 1996 after serving in the Royal Australian Air Force and a range of vocations thereafter. He rose only to parliamentary secretary rank during the Howard years, a position he held from 1998 to 2006. However, his local popularity was illustrated when the Liberals lost Leichhardt with a 14.3% swing upon his temporary retirement in 2007, followed by an 8.6% swing in his favour when he returned in 2010.</p>
			<p>Entsch's vocal advocacy for same-sex marriage brought him into conflict with some of his more conservative colleagues, and he was identified as having supported Malcolm Turnbull against Tony Abbott in September 2015 and Peter Dutton in August 2018. However, he confused matters shortly after the latter event by providing the decisive forty-third signature to a petition calling for a second spill, and it is not known who he supported in the subsequent ballot between Scott Morrison and Peter Dutton.</p>

			<p>Lilley has existed in name since 1913, but it originally extended as far north as Gympie and did not become entirely urban until 1949. It leaned conservative for much of its history, with Labor ekeing out wins in 1943, 1946, 1961 and 1972. Labor's dominance began when Elaine Darling gained it in 1980, then consolidated with an 8.4% swing in 1983.</p>
			<p>Darling was succeeded in 1993 by Wayne Swan, later to serve as Treasurer from Labor's election win in November 2007 until Kevin Rudd's return to the prime ministership in June 2013. Swan was unseated in 1996, together with all but one of his Queensland Labor colleagues, but recovered the seat in 1998 and increased his margin at each of the next three elections.

	<district id="Longman" name="Longman">
		<background>
			<p>Located on Brisbane's northern fringe, Longman has played a significant role in recent electoral history, most recently when Terry Young gained it for the Liberal National Party off the statewide swing in 2019. The defeated Labor member, Susan Lamb, had retained the seat at a by-election held in July 2018 amid the spate of disqualifications arising out of the Section 44 crisis, a result that played a central role in Malcolm Turnbull's demise as Prime Minister a month later.</p>
			<p>Longman was won for the Liberals by Mal Brough when it was created in 1996 as one of six seats brought into being by Queensland's population growth between 1993 and 2010. It had a notional Liberal margin of 1.6% going into the 1996 election, to which Brough added a further 10.0% amid a disastrous result for Labor across Queensland. Brough was nonetheless lucky to survive in 1998, when a 1.6% redistribution shift followed by a 9.1% swing reduced his margin to 0.5%. He then gained successive swings of 1.8% in 2001 and 5.2% in 2004, emerging in the meantime as a senior figure in the Howard government.</p>
			<p>Brough's profile did not save him from Kevin Rudd's sweep through Queensland in 2007, when the seat was gained for Labor by Jon Sullivan, who had served the area in state parliament from 1989 to 1998 as member for Glass House and Caboolture, ultimately losing the latter seat to One Nation. Sullivan picked up a 10.3% swing, one of the six double-digit swings to Labor in Queensland. Brough would later return to parliament for one eventful term as member for Fisher from 2013 and 2016.</p>
			<p>Sullivan lasted only one term, in common with six other Queensland Labor MPs who gained their seats in 2007, before a 3.8% swing accounted for a margin that a redistribution had cut from 3.6% to 1.9%. The result made the successful LNP candidate, 20-year-old Wyatt Roy, the youngest person ever elected to the House of Representatives. Roy picked up a further 5.0% swing in 2013 before falling victim to a 7.7% swing in 2016, the biggest in the state. This was partly due to One Nation's decision to put Roy behind Labor candidate Susan Lamb on their how-to-vote cards, leading to an uncommonly strong 56.5% out of their 9.4% vote flowing to Labor.</p>
			<p>Lamb was compelled to resign from her seat in May 2018 over a dual British citizenship acquired through her late Scottish-born father, after the High Court disqualified the similarly placed Senator Katy Gallagher. She then recontested the seat at one of the five &#8220;Super Saturday&#8221; by-elections on July 28, at which she added 3.6% to her margin. While this was a modest anti-government swing by by-election standards, the pressure on Malcolm Turnbull was compounded by a 9.4% drop in the LNP primary vote, with One Nation recording 15.9%.</p>
			<p>The major parties' primary vote shares in 2019 differed only slightly from the 2016 result, with the LNP down 0.4% to 38.6% and Labor down 1.3% to 34.1%. However, this translated into a two-party swing of 4.1% due to a markedly different flow of preferences, with 66.1% of One Nation's 13.2% share of the vote now going to the LNP.</p>

			<p>Before its creation in 1996, Longman's territory was mostly in Fisher, which thereafter became a safe conservative seat anchored at the southern end of the Sunshine Coast.

			<p>Remote Queensland Nationals stronghold that has the highest Coalition-versus-Labor margin of any seat in the country, although it was in fact One Nation that made the final count against the Nationals in both 2016 and 2019, uniquely out of any electorate in both cases. The member since 2016 has been David Littleproud, who has served in cabinet since December 2017.</p>
			<p>Reflecting a familiar pattern in rural Queensland, Maranoa began life as a Labor stronghold and progressively moved to the other extreme with the decline of the shearing and railway workforce. The first changeover occurred in 1921, when James Hunter gained the seat for the Country Party after the death of the inaugural Labor member, Jim Page. Francis Baker recovered it for Labor on Hunter's retirement in 1940, but lasted only a single term before becoming the only Labor member to lose his seat with the party's landslide win in 1943.</p>
			<p>Maranoa was then held for the Country Party by Charles Adermann until he moved to the new seat of Fisher in 1949. Adermann was succeeded in Maranoa by Charles Russell, who quit the Country Party to sit as an independent a year later and was narrowly defeated in both 1951 and 1954. This was the last time the Country Party was seriously troubled, with the seat successively being held by Wilfred Brindlecombe (1951-66), James Corbett (1966-80), Ian Cameron (1980-90) and Bruce Scott (1990-2016).</p>
			<p>Barnaby Joyce hoped to facilitate his move from the Senate to the House of Representatives by succeeding Scott in 2013, but instilled fulfilled his ambitions by moving to the New South Wales seat of New England when Scott proved determined on serving another term. Scott duly retired in 2016, and the seat has since been held by David Littleproud, who fell just short of a primary vote majority in 2016 before easily clearing it in 2019.</p>
		</background>

			<p>Maranoa has covered a fairly consistent area of south-western Queensland since it was created at federation, currently accounting for about 40% of Queensland's surface area. Most of the voters are concentrated at the eastern end, which includes the centres of Kingaroy, Dalby and Warwick, respectively lying to the north, west and south of Toowoomba.</p>
			<p>Typically for a rural electorate, Maranoa is distinguished by low incomes and high school completion rates and a lack of ethnic diversity, along with a large proportion of people identifying as Christian. Its 56.1% no vote in the late 2017 same-sex marriage survey was the tenth highest in the country, with all those placed above it being migrant-heavy electorates in Sydney and Melbourne.</p>

			<p>Littleproud was elevated to cabinet in December 2017 as Agriculture and Water Resources Minister, an apparent beneficiary of Barnaby Joyce's animus towards Darren Chester, who was dropped to make way for him. His portfolio load became water resources, drought, rural finance, natural disaster and emergency management after the 2019 election, with agriculture transferred to Bridget McKenzie.</p>
			<p>When McKenzie resigned from cabinet in February 2020, Littleproud won a party room vote to succeed her as deputy ahead of David Gillespie and Keith Pitt, and also returned to agriculture while relinquishing water resources. He further exchanged emergency management for northern Australia when Barnaby Joyce returned to the leadership in June 2021. He was reportedly a late convert to Joyce's return, and said he would have nominated himself if McCormack had withdrawn.</p>

It was retained for the Liberals by Peter White at a by-election after Robinson's death in 1981, at which the Nationals candidate was Glenister Sheil, who had previously been a Senator and would return to that role from 1984 to 1990.</p>
			<p>The only interruption to Liberal control after 1972 came when John Bradford, who succeeded White in 1990, quit the party to join Fred Nile's Christian Democratic Party in 1998. White ran unsuccessfully as that party's Queensland Senate candidate later that year, and was succeeded in McPherson by Margaret May.</p>
			<p>May's retirement in 2010 prompted Peter Dutton to seek Liberal preselection in pursuit of a safer berth than his existing seat of Dickson, where he had survived by 217 votes in 2007. However, the preselection was won by Karen Andrews, despite backing for Dutton from John Howard and then Liberal leader Malcolm Turnbull.</p>

		<background>
			<p>Southern Brisbane seat that has been marginal in its recent history, though with a recent lean to Labor that has made it one of two seats to have remained with the party out of the nine gained in Queensland in 2007. The member throughout this period has been Graham Perrett, who has held margins ranging from 1.1% in 2010 to 4.7% in 2007.</p>
			<p>Moreton has existed in name since federation, when it was a semi-rural conservative seat that encompassed the Gold Coast. The latter was transferred to the new seat of McPherson in 1949, and Moreton became entirely urban in character in 1955, while remaining in Liberal hands through to 1990. The member from 1955 to 1983 was Jim Killen, who famously held on by 130 votes in 1961 to secure a one-seat majority for the Menzies government.</p>
			<p>Killen retired in the wake of the Fraser government's defeat in March 1983, which reduced his own margin to 1.6%. This initiated a by-election the following November at which the seat was retained for the Liberals on a 2.8% margin by Don Cameron, who had earlier served in Griffith from 1969 and then in Fadden from 1977, where he was defeated at the 1983 election.</p>
			<p>Labor finally broke through in 1990, when Garrie Gibson unseated Cameron amid a weak performance for the Coalition across Queensland. Gibson survived a small swing to the Liberals in 1993 before being ousted in the statewide tidal wave of 1996, when he suffered what by Queensland standards was a modest swing of 4.9%. The seat was then held through the Howard years by Gary Hardgrave, a former children's television host and later talk radio presenter.</p>
			<p>Hardgrave was one of the Coalition's many Queensland casualties of 2007, when Perrett gained the seat with a 7.6% swing. Perrett enjoyed what proved to be a decisive 1.4% boost at the redistribution before the 2010 election, after which a 4.9% swing cut his margin to 1.1%. He then gained a 0.4% swing at the 2013 election, when Labor did better in Queensland than it had earlier feared, followed by a further 2.5% swing in 2016 and a 2.1% reversal in 2019.</p>

			<p>Still best known two decades later as the electorate held for a term by Pauline Hanson, the Ipswich-based seat of Oxley has otherwise been in Labor hands since 1961. It has been held since 2016 by Milton Dick, who secured a 9.1% margin on debut that was reduced to 6.4% amid Labor's poor result in Queensland in 2019.</p>
			<p>Oxley was held for the Liberals by Donald Cameron (not to be confused with the later member for Griffith, Fadden and Moreton) from its creation in 1949 until 1961, when it was gained for Labor by Bill Hayden with a 9.4% swing. This portended a long-term shift in the seat's voting behaviour that left it as Labor's last seat standing in Queensland after the disaster of 1975.</p>
			<p>Hayden went on to lead Labor in Opposition from 1978 to 1983 and serve as Foreign Minister in the early Hawke years, before accepting the position of Governor-General in 1988. By this time Oxley was safe enough that Les Scott was able to retain it for Labor at the resulting by-election by a 4.0% margin in the face of an 11.8% swing, before restoring the margin to double digits in 1990 and 1993.</p>
			<p>Pauline Hanson's endorsement as Liberal candidate at the 1996 election reflected the party's low regard for its prospects, despite the then Labor government's unpopularity in Queensland. However, Hanson gained national attention during the campaign with her criticism of Aboriginal welfare policies and subsequent disendorsement as Liberal candidate, which came too late to prevent her being identified as such on the ballot paper. She was then elected with 48.6% of the primary vote, defeating Scott by 4.7% after preferences.</p>
			<p>Oxley lost much of its territory to the newly created seat of Blair at the 1998 election, prompting Hanson to calculate that the new seat offered her the better prospects. Bernie Ripoll had no trouble regaining Oxley for Labor, and retained it comfortably through to his retirement in 2016, when he was succeeded by Milton Dick.</p>

			<p>The modern electorate of Oxley was created around the satellite city of Ipswich west of Brisbane in 1949, in territory previously accommodated by Moreton. Another seat called Oxley had existed from 1901 to 1934, but it covered southern Brisbane and was properly the antecedent of Griffith.</p>
			<p>Oxley covers two electorally distinct areas, combining a northern end consisting of Mount Ommaney and the southern bank of the Brisbane River, which are wealthy and conservative, with Labor strongholds around Goodna and Inala further south, the latter being the hub of Brisbane's Vietnamese community.</p>

			<p>Northern Brisbane seat that has had a bellwether record going back to 1987, having changed hands along with government in 1996, 2007 and 2013. It has been held for the Liberal National Party since the current government came to power in 2013 by Luke Howarth, who enjoyed a thumping 6.8% swing in 2019 after narrow wins at his first two elections.</p>
			<p>Petrie was created with the enlargement of parliament in 1949 and held by the Liberals for all but one term until 1983, the exception being with the Menzies government's near defeat in 1961. Labor next gained the seat when the Hawke government came to power in 1983, lost it again in 1984, then recovered it in 1987. It was then held for three terms by Gary Johns, who would later associate himself with conservative causes as a senior fellow of the Institute of Public Affairs and columnist for The Australian.</p>
			<p>Johns was unseated along with all but two of his Queensland Labor colleagues in 1996, when a swing of 9.8% easily accounted for his margin of 2.1%. The seat was then held for the Liberals through the Howard years by Teresa Gambaro, who narrowly survived the correction to Labor in 1998 before strengthening her hold in 2001 and 2004. Gambaro's 7.9% margin going into the 2007 election was accounted for by a 9.5% swing to Labor's Yvette D'Ath, and she later returned to parliament as the member for Brisbane from 2010 to 2016.</p>
			<p>D'Ath did well to limit the swing against her in 2010 to 1.7%, which was well below the statewide swing of 5.6% and sufficient for her to retain a 2.5% margin. She was less fortunate in 2013, when a further 3.0% swing led her narrow defeat. She returned to politics as the state member for Redcliffe at a by-election in February 2014, and has served as Attorney-General and Health Minister in the Palaszczuk government.</p>
			<p>After gaining the seat by a 0.5% margin in 2013, Luke Howarth scored a crucial victory when he gained a 1.1% swing against the national trend in 2016, followed by an emphatic win in 2019.</p>

			<p>Rankin was won on its inauguration in 1984 by David Beddall, who retained modest margins until the seat was transformed by redistribution in 1996, when conservative rural areas out to the New South Wales border were exchanged for low-income Brisbane suburbs. He needed every bit of the resulting 9.8% boost to hold off the backlash against Labor at the ensuing election, which left Rankin and Brisbane as the only two seats left to Labor in Queensland.</p>
			<p>Beddall's retirement in 1998 coincided with a redistribution that gave the seat a small notional Liberal margin, but his successor Craig Emerson easily accounted for this with a 9.1% swing. Another unfavourable redistribution cut the margin from 6.7% to 2.4% going into the 2004 election, but Emerson picked up a 0.8% swing against the statewide trend. He consolidated with an 8.8% swing when Kevin Rudd swept to power in 2007, followed by a 6.3% reversal in the changed circumstances of 2010.</p>
			<p>The seat has continued to move with broader statewide trends since Chalmers became member at the 2013 election, at which there was a 0.6% swing against Labor. This involved a 6.5% swing to Labor in 2016, followed by a 4.9% swing the other way in 2019.</p>

Labor has never held the seat, becoming particularly uncompetitive after territory in southern Adelaide was ceded to the new seat of Kingston in 1949.</p>
			<p>Barker was held for the Country Party from 1934 to 1940 by Archie Cameron, who defected to the United Australia Party a year after being dumped as the party's leader and carried on as a Liberal member after the party was founded in 1944. It has remained in Liberal hands ever since, being held from 1990 to 1998 by Ian McLachlan, a former National Farmers Federation president who had been touted as a future prime minister. However, his ministerial career was limited to a single term as Defence Minister, followed by his unexpected retirement ahead of the 1998 election.</p>
			<p>McLachlan was succeeded by Patrick Secker, who led a generally low-profile parliamentary career before losing preselection ahead of the 2013 election to Tony Pasin. The seat was one of four in South Australia in which the Nick Xenophon Team reached the last preference count at the 2016 election, at which Pasin emerged with a 4.7% margin.

			<p>Barker has been anchored to the state's south-eastern corner since South Australia was first divided into single-member electorates in 1903, and has at all times encompassed Mount Gambier, Bordertown and Keith. From there it has generally extended either westwards to the Fleurieu Peninsula and Kangaroo Island or, as at present, northwards to the Riverland.

		<background>
			<p>Southern Adelaide seat that has developed into a keenly fought marginal in recent times, despite being held by the Liberals without interruption since 1949. Labor's hopes for the coming election have been elevated by the retirement of Nicolle Flint, who came to the seat in 2016 in succession to Andrew Southcott. Flint suffered consecutive swings of 3.6% and 1.3% at her two elections in 2016 and 2019, which together with a 0.8% shift in the intervening redistribution reduced the Liberal margin to 1.4% from a high point of 7.1% in 2013.</p>
			<p>The Liberals' win with the election of the Menzies government in 1949 marked the beginning of a long-term trend in their favour that peaked in the 1970s, when margins were consistently in double digits. The member from 1981 to 1996 was Steele Hall, former state Premier and figurehead of the early 1970s breakaway Liberal Movement. A trend to Labor became evident after Hall was succeeded by Andrew Southcott in 1996, with successive swings recorded over the next five elections.</p>
			<p>Labor had a particularly encouraging swing amid an otherwise poor result in 2004, prompting it to target the seat at the next two elections. Right faction powerbrokers recruited what they imagined to be a star candidate in 2007 in Nicole Cornes, a minor Adelaide celebrity and wife of local football legend Graham Cornes. However, Cornes was damaged by heavily publicised poor media performances and managed a swing of only 2.4% compared with a statewide result of 6.8%. A further 2.2% swing followed against the national trend in 2010, but this still left Labor 0.8% short of a win it desperately needed to balance losses in Queensland and New South Wales.</p>
			<p>Southcott had a much easier time of it when the seat fell from Labor's list of targets in 2013, breaking a run of five successive adverse swings to boost his margin from 0.6% to 7.1%. His retirement in 2016 coincided with the peak of the Nick Xenophon Team, whose candidate polled 20.7%, though the seat was not among the four in which its candidates made the final preference count.</p>

			<p>Boothby has existed in name when South Australia was first divided into electorates in 1903, but it covered shifting ground around the Adelaide Hills and the city's inner south until 1993, when the abolition of Hawker drew it to the coast. Its coastal territory currently runs from Glenelg, which was gained from Hindmarsh at the 2019 election, through Brighton to Marino at the southern end. From there it extends inland through Marion and surrounding coastal plain suburbs to the Adelaide Hills at Belair and Bellevue Heights. A general lean to the Liberals is softened by the area around the defunct Mitsubishi plant in Tonsley Park, the only part with below average incomes and above average ethnic diversity.</p>

		<background>
			<p>Grey covers the vast majority of South Australia's largely empty land mass, with the population concentrated in the &#8220;iron triangle&#8221; industrial cities of Port Augusta, Port Pirie and Whyalla and rural territory near the coast. The industrial cities once made the seat reliable for Labor, but their decline over recent decades has effected a decisive shift to the Liberals.</p>
			<p>Labor held Grey for all but one term from 1943 and 1993, the exception being with the landslide defeat of 1966. It was recovered in 1969 by Laurie Wallis, who retained margins of 563 votes in 1975 and 65 votes in 1977, ultimately bequeathing the seat to Lloyd O'Neil in 1983.</p>
			<p>The turning point came with O'Neil's retirement at the 1993 election, at which Barry Wakelin gained the seat for the Liberals with a 4.3% swing. Wakelin strengthened his position thereafter with swings of 6.4% in 1996, 1.9% in 2001 and 3.2% in 2004, leaving a margin of 13.8% to Rowan Ramsay on his retirement in 2007.</p>
			<p>A 9.4% swing to Labor cut the margin to 4.4% on Ramsay's debut, but he strongly consolidated with swings of 6.7% in 2010 and 2.4% in 2013. Ramsay came under pressure in 2016 from Nick Xenophon Team candidate Andrea Broadfoot, who reached the final count after outpolling Labor with 27.7% of the primary vote, but he emerged 2.0% clear after preferences. The seat returned to the safe Liberal column in 2019, when Broadfoot managed only 5.1% under the Centre Alliance banner.</p>

			<p>Grey has covered the bulk of South Australia's land mass since the state was first divided into electorates in 1903, and presently encompasses much the same territory as it did on its creation. The state's eastern regions north of the Riverland have at times been accommodated by Wakefield, but Grey has consistently accounted for the western part of the state and the three cities of the &#8220;iron triangle&#8221;.</p>
			<p>Labor is strong in the electorate's largest centre of Whyalla, with a population of around 22,000, while Port Augusta and Port Pirie, each home to around 13,000, have been finely balanced in recent times. The remainder tips the balance to the Liberals, including Port Lincoln on the lower Eyre Peninsula and a scattered rural population that accounts for around 60% of the electorate's population.</p>

	<district id="Hindmarsh" name="Hindmarsh">
		<background>
			<p>Coastal Adelaide electorate that was transformed from marginal to safe Labor in 2019 as a result of the abolition of Port Adelaide, whose member Mark Butler now holds the seat. The existing member for Hindmarsh, Steve Georganas, transferred to neighbouring Adelaide, which was vacated by the retirement of Kate Ellis.</p>
			<p>Hindmarsh was one of the seven seats created when South Australia's electoral boundaries were first drawn in 1903, and was a Labor stronghold for much of its early history due to its orientation around the working-class suburbs of north-western Adelaide. The creation of the Port Adelaide electorate in 1949 made it somewhat less secure, pushing it southwards into more conservative Henley Beach, but it remained in Labor hands until 1993, when the abolition of Hawker drew it further south into Liberal-voting Glenelg.</p>
			<p>The successful Liberal candidate in 1993 was Christine Gallus, who successively became the first Liberal ever to win Hawker in 1990 and the first Liberal ever to win Hindmarsh in 1993. Liberal strategists rated Gallus's vote-pulling power very highly, and were duly dismayed when she retired in 2004. Hindmarsh was duly gained for Labor by Steve Georganas, although his winning margin was only 108 votes. The unsuccessful Liberal candidate was Simon Birmingham, who went on to enter the Senate in 2007.</p>
			<p>Georganas held the seat for Labor from 2004 to 2019 outside of the interruption of 2013 to 2016, when it was held for the Liberals by Matt Williams. Swings in Georganas's favour in 2007 and 2010 were modest by South Australian standards, leaving him with a weaker margin going into the 2013 election than his colleagues in Makin, Kingston and Wakefield, all of which had stayed with the Liberals in 2004. Williams then accounted for the 6.1% margin with a swing of 8.0%, the largest in the state, before Georganas recovered the seat with a 2.5% swing in 2016.</p>
			<p>Meanwhile, the neighbouring seat of Port Adelaide to the north provided Labor with a reliable seat that was home to senior party figure Mick Young from 1974 to 1988, and then by the rather lower profile Rod Sawford through to 2007. It was held thereafter by Mark Butler, whose considerable power base in the Left faction ensured he was accommodated in Hindmarsh when it absorbed much of Port Adelaide's territory upon its abolition in 2019.</p>

			<p>Hindmarsh encompasses coastal Adelaide from West Beach at the southern end, located due west of the city centre, to the Lefevre Peninsula in the north.

Labor draws its strength from the northern end, which formerly constituted around half of the Port Adelaide electorate.</p>

			<p>Labor member <b>Mark Butler</b> was state secretary of the Left faction Liquor Hospitality and Miscellaneous Workers Union before entering parliament in 2007. He is a descendant of two conservative state premiers: his great- and great-great-grandfathers, both called Sir Richard Butler.</p>
			<p>Butler served in cabinet as Minister for Mental Health and Aged Care from December 2011 until Labor's defeat in September 2013. He was publicly hesitant about joining the Julia Gillard bandwagon in June 2010, but supported her against Kevin Rudd's challenge in February 2012 before defecting to Rudd on his successful second attempt in June 2013.</p>
			<p>In opposition, Butler has served in shadow cabinet in environment for the first term, climate change and energy from the 2016 election to January 2021, and health and ageing thereafter. He was accommodated in Hindmarsh after the abolition of Port Adelaide in 2019 through a deal in which the Left forfeited a seat in the Senate.</p>
			<p>The Liberal candidate is <b>Anna Finizio</b>, who was an adviser to state Health Minister Stephen Wade until the Marshall government's election defeat in March. Finizio was installed as candidate by the party's state executive shortly before the closure of nominations, a fact that was seen to reflect the party's lack of confidence in its prospects for the ostensibly marginal seat.</p>

	<district id="Kingston" name="Kingston">
		<background>
			<p>Outer southern Adelaide seat that was marginal for most of its history, before strengthening considerably for Labor after Amanda Rishworth gained it with the election of the Rudd government in 2007. Rishworth has been re-elected with double-digit margins at four of the five elections since, and only narrowly fell short of doing in 2013.</p>
			<p>Kingston was oriented further to the north around Glenelg when created with the enlargement of parliament at the 1949 election, being won on that occasion by the Liberals off the back of a 6.8% swing. Labor thereafter held the seat from 1951 to 1975, outside of the term from 1966 to 1969, when it reflected the statewide trend in recording consecutive double-digit swings first to Liberal and then to Labor.</p>
			<p>The seat established a bellwether record from 1972 to 1998, being won for the Liberals in 1975 by Grant Chapman, who later returned as a Senator in 1987; for Labor in 1983 by Gordon Bilney; and for Liberal in 1996 by Susan Jeanes. The pattern was broken in 1998, when Labor's David Cox unseated Jeanes by 763 votes. Cox held the seat for two terms before emerging on the wrong end of another close result in 2004, when Kym Richardson gained it for the Liberals by 119 votes.</p>
			<p>Richardson lasted only one term before the seat was swept up in the Labor tide in 2007, when Amanda Rishworth picked up a decisive 4.5% swing. Rishworth was emphatically returned in 2010 with a 9.5% swing, the biggest to Labor of that election. Her margin was cut back by 4.9% amid Labor's defeat in 2013, but she enjoyed another strong result in 2016 with a 7.4% swing, followed by a 1.6% shift back to the Liberals in 2019.</p>

		<background>
			<p>North-eastern Adelaide seat that was in Liberal hands through the Howard years, but has since joined the city's other traditionally marginal seats in becoming secure for Labor. The margin peaked at 12.2% with Labor's particularly strong result in South Australia in 2010, before a 6.9% swing back to the Liberals in 2013, a 4.6% swing to Labor in 2016, and a 1.1% Liberal swing in 2019.</p>
			<p>Makin was created with the enlargement of parliament in 1984 from an area that had mostly formed the southern end of the safe Labor seat of Bonython, which was abolished in 2004. It was held for Labor on narrow margins by Peter Duncan, a former state Attorney-General, from 1984 until the defeat of the Keating government in 1996, when he was ousted by a swing of 4.8%. Trish Draper then held the seat for the Liberals through the Howard years, doing particularly well to limit the swing against her to 0.2% in 1998 in the face of a 4.2% swing to Labor statewide.</p>
			<p>Draper hit trouble in the lead-up to the 2004 election when it emerged she had breached parliamentary rules by taking a boyfriend on a study trip to Europe at taxpayer expense, but she survived by 0.9% in the face of a negative swing that was not reflected in neighbouring seats. She retired at the 2007 election, at which the seat was won for Labor on the second attempt by Tony Zappia, who demolished the 0.9% Liberal margin with a swing of 8.6%. This was achieved despite a well-funded campaign by Liberal candidate Bob Day, housing tycoon and later Family First Senator.</p>

		<background>
			<p>Former Liberal stronghold in the hinterland of Adelaide that has been held since 2016 by Rebekha Sharkie, progressively for the Nick Xenophon Team and its successor, the Centre Alliance. Alexander Downer held the seat for the Liberals from its creation in 1984 until 2008, serving as Foreign Minister throughout the period of the Howard government. Downer had one close shave electorally in 1998, when Australian Democrats candidate John Schumann, former lead singer of folk group Redgum (of &#8220;I Was Only Nineteen&#8221; fame), finished ahead of Labor and came within 1.7% of winning the seat after preferences.</p>
			<p>Downer quit politics after the Howard government's defeat, resulting in a by-election at which the seat was retained for the Liberals by Jamie Briggs. The seat again demonstrated its penchant for minor parties on that occasion, with Greens candidate Lynton Vonow coming within 3.0% of winning in the absence of a Labor candidate. Briggs was comfortably returned in 2010 and 2013, but ran into trouble in 2015 after an accusation of inappropriate behaviour towards a female Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade official prompted his resignation from the outer ministry.</p>
			<p>Mayo then emerged as the prime target of the Nick Xenophon Team, whose candidate, Rebekha Sharkie, duly unseated Briggs with a 5.0% winning margin off strong preference flows from Labor and the Greens. Sharkie became embroiled in the Section 44 crisis in May 2018 after the High Court disqualified Australian Capital Territory Labor Senator Katy Gallagher, who like Sharkie was ruled to have had a dual British citizenship at the time of the 2016 election. This set up a by-election the following July that proved to be the first of two contests between Sharkie and Liberal candidate Georgina Downer, the daughter of Alexander Downer.</p>
			<p>Sharkie went untroubled on both occasions, increasing her primary vote from 34.9% to 44.4% at the by-election amid a weak result for Labor, and her two-party margin from 5.0% to 7.5%. The 2019 election result was more like that of 2016, with Downer outpolling Sharkie on the primary vote, but Sharkie again secured a comfortable 5.1% margin after preferences.</p>

Its largest population centres are Mount Barker and Strathalbyn in the east, Victor Harbour on the southern side of the Fleurieu Peninsula, and coastal Aldinga Beach at the southern tip of Adelaide. The electorate has the country's fifth lowest share of non-English speakers and its sixth highest share of persons identifying as non-religious or secular.</p>
			<p>Most of Mayo's territory was in Barker before 1984, which like Mayo has never been held by Labor. However, the redistribution before the 2019 election made Labor potentially competitive in Mayo by adding the area around Aldinga Beach. The Liberal two-party margin against Labor was reduced from 5.4% to 3.3%, and then to 2.5% at the 2019 election, albeit that the Liberal vote was likely subdued by the unusual circumstance of Rebekha Sharkie's candidacy.</p>

			<p>Sharkie was obliged to resign and recontest the seat in July 2018 after the rolling Section 44 crisis drew attention to the fact that her renunciation of British citizenship had not taken effect before her nomination in 2016.

The seat will be vacated at the election by Labor member Nick Champion, who will contest the corresponding seat of Taylor at the looming state election.</p>
			<p>Wakefield became recognisable as the electorate now known as Spence in 2004, when the abolition of Bonython caused it to absorb the strongly Labor-voting outer suburban industrial centre of Elizabeth. It has previously been a largely rural seat that was lost by the prevailing conservative party of the day only in 1938 and 1943, when it was won by Labor, and 1928, when it was won by the Country Party.</p>
			<p>The seat was won for the Liberals in 2004 by David Fawcett ahead of Martyn Evans, who had held Bonython for Labor since 1994, accounting for a notional Labor margin of 1.5% swing a swing of 2.2%. Fawcett's slender margin was demolished by a 7.3% swing to Labor candidate Nick Champion in 2007, but he would later return to parliament as a Senator after the 2010 election.</p>
			<p>Champion consolidated with a further 5.4% swing amid Labor's strong performance in South Australia in 2010, before an unfavourable redistribution and a 7.1% swing pared it back to 3.4% in 2013. He bounced back with a 7.6% swing in 2016, and then received a 6.2% boost when the electorate exchanged the Clare Valley for suburban Paralowie and its surrounds in the redistribution that changed its name to Spence.</p>

It has been held since the 2019 election by James Stevens, who succeeded Christopher Pyne, the member since 1993.</p>
			<p>Sturt was held by Labor for the first three terms after its creation in 1949, but at that time it encompassed northern Adelaide, which was ceded to the new electorate of Bonython in 1955. Labor's only win after that time was in 1969, when first-term Liberal member Ian Wilson was unseated by a 15.0% swing as part of a statewide wave to Labor. Wilson recovered the seat in 1972, when both the seat and the state bucked the national trend that brought the Whitlam government to power.</p>
			<p>Wilson retained the seat by margins of between 2.0% and 10.3% until 1993, when he was defeated for preselection by Christopher Pyne. Pyne's hold was tested at Labor's high-water mark in 2007 and 2010, first with a 5.9% swing that reduced his margin to 0.9%, which was followed by a 2.5% swing in his favour.

	<district id="Bass" name="Bass">
		<background>
			<p>Covering the north-east of Tasmania and dominated by Launceston, Bass has loomed large in Australia's recent electoral history, having changed hands at eight of the last ten elections. It also has a place in political folklore for a by-election in June 1975 that emboldened the Coalition under Malcolm Fraser to block supply. Bridget Archer gained the seat for the Liberals in 2019 from one-term Labor member Ross Hart, who will again contest the seat at the coming election.</p>
			<p>Labor first won Bass when Jens Jensen gained it at the 1910 election, the first at which Labor won a parliamentary majority, and lost it when Jensen followed Billy Hughes into the Nationalist Party in 1916. Jensen retained the seat as a Nationalist in 1917, and it stayed with the party after he lost its endorsement in 1919.</p>
			<p>Labor's next win came with the election of Jim Scullin's government in 1929, but the seat was again lost to a party split when Allan Guy followed Joseph Lyons into the United Australia Party in 1931. Guy was re-elected as the UAP candidate at that year's election, before Claude Barnard recovered it for Labor in 1934. Barnard retained the seat through to the election of the Menzies government in 1949, when he was defeated by Liberal candidate Bruce Kekwick.</p>
			<p>The seat returned to the Barnard family fold in 1954 when Kekwick was unseated by Lance Barnard, son of Claude Bernard, who went on to serve as Deputy Prime Minister under Gough Whitlam from 1972 to 1974. The famed 1975 by-election followed Barnard's mid-term resignation, ostensibly due to ill health but coming a year after he lost the deputy leadership. A plunge in the Labor primary vote from 54.0% to 36.5% delivered the seat to Liberal candidate Kevin Newman, father of Campbell Newman and husband of Howard government minister Jocelyn Newman, emboldening the Coalition in its strategy of forcing an early election.</p>
			<p>Bass would remain in the Liberal fold for 18 years, partly reflecting Tasmania's bucking of the national trend to Labor under Bob Hawke due to the Franklin dam controversy. Kevin Newman was succeeded in 1984 by Warwick Smith, whose promising career was twice stymied by the vagaries of electoral fortune: in 1993, when he lost to Sylvia Smith by 40 votes, and in 1998, when he lost to Michelle O'Byrne by 78 votes, after recovering the seat in 1996.</p>
			<p>Michelle O'Byrne served two terms before suffering a decisive 4.5% swing in 2004, after then Labor leader Mark Latham's restrictive policy on old-growth logging invoked the wrath of local unions and state Labor politicians. It was then held for the Liberals by Michael Ferguson, who was in turn unseated by a 3.6% swing in 2007. Both O'Byrne and Ferguson have gone on to more enduring careers in state politics.</p>
			<p>Ferguson's Labor successor, Jodie Campbell, was yet another one-term member, though in this case because she opted to retire amid reports her preselection was under threat. The seat was in fact retained for Labor in 2010 by Geoff Lyons with a 5.7% swing, as Tasmanian once again bucked a national trend. However, Lyons' margin proved insufficient in the face of an anti-Labor wave in 2013 that cost the party each of Bass and neighbouring Braddon and Lyons off double-digit swings.</p>
			<p>The seat was then held for the Liberals by Andrew Nikolic, an army brigadier who had served in Iraq and Afghanistan and a close ally of Tony Abbott's. Nikolic was heavily defeated when Bass, Braddon and Lyons all returned to Labor in 2016, in this case with a 10.1% swing. Bass and Braddon changed hands yet again in 2019, when Liberal candidate Bridget Archer narrowly succeeded in unseating Labor's Ross Hart with a 5.8% swing.</p>

			<p>About 70% of the population of Bass resides in Launceston, which is located in the electorate's south-west. From there the electorate extends northwards along the Tamar River and eastwards along the coast. Together with the rest of northern Tasmania, Bass is distinctive for low levels of income, education attainment and ethnic diversity, although not quite to the same extent as Braddon and Lyons. The electorate has existed on much the same boundaries since Tasmania was first divided into single-member electorates in 1903, a result of the state's constitutionally mandated minimum of five seats.</p>

			<p>Covering the north-west of Tasmania and its thinly populated western coast, Braddon has changed hands at each of the past three elections, current member Gavin Pearce having gained it for the Liberals in 2019 with a 4.8% swing. The defeated Labor member, Justine Keay, had been among those embroiled in the Section 44 crisis, resulting in a by-election in July 2018 at which she added 0.1% to her 2.2% margin from 2016.</p>
			<p>In common with Tasmania's other four federal seats, Braddon has had an uninterrupted existence going back to the original district of the state into single-member seats in 1903, although it had the somewhat confusing name of Darwin until 1955. Darwin was held by Labor legend King O'Malley from its creation until 1917, and then by conservatives of various stripes until Ron Davies' win for Labor in 1958. Davies held the seat until his defeat by future Premier Ray Groom in 1975, in the first in a series of Liberal clean sweeps of Tasmania that continued to 1984.</p>
			<p>The Liberals' position strengthened amid the Franklin Dam controversy of the early 1980s, such that Chris Miles was able to retain the seat for the Liberals when Groom moved to state politics in 1984. However, fortunes changed suddenly in 1998, when a 10.0% swing made Peter &#8220;Sid&#8221; Sidebottom the seat's first Labor member in 23 years. Sidebottom held the seat through to his defeat in 2013 outside of the interruption of 2004 to 2007, when Mark Baker gained it for the Liberals after John Howard trumped Mark Latham on forestry policy in the final week of the election campaign.</p>
			<p>After recovering the seat in 2007 with a modest 2.6% swing, Sidebottom added a further 5.1% to his margin in 2010 before falling victim to a 10.0% swing in 2013. Braddon was then held for a term by Brett Whiteley, who had been a member for Braddon in the state parliament from 2002 until his defeat in 2010. Whiteley was unseated after a 4.8% swing to Labor's Justine Keay in 2016, and again contested the seat unsuccessfully at the 2018 by-election.</p>

			<p>Braddon encompasses the northern coastal centres of Davenport, Ulverstone, Burnie, Wynyard and Somerset, and acquired the full length of the thinly populated west coast in 2010, including the mining towns around Queenstown. Labor's greatest source of strength is Burnie, which accounts for slightly less than a fifth of the population, although it has also traditionally had a slight advantage in Devonport, home to around a quarter.</p>
			<p>The timber and mining industries that have traditionally provided a solid base for Labor are balanced by beef and dairy farming, which contribute to a more conservative lean around Smithton in the west. The electorate shares bottom rankings in the country for educational attainment and ethnic diversity with neighbouring Lyons, and ranks ninth lowest for median income.</p>

		<background>
			<p>Covering most of Hobart, Clark has been held since 2010 by independent Andrew Wilkie, having lately distinguished itself at both federal and state elections for its green-left tendencies. It was known as Denison from its creation in 1903 until 2016, when it was renamed in honour of constitutional founding father Andrew Inglis Clark.</p>
			<p>Denison was hotly contested between the major parties from Labor's first win in 1910 until 1987, having gone with the winning party at every election from 1943 to 1980. Its last Liberal member was Michael Hodgman, father of future state Premier Will Hodgman and himself a state parliamentarian both before and after his time as a federal member. Hodgman benefited from the statewide backlash against Labor amid the Franklin dam controversy in 1983, but his margin was first reduced in 1984 and then eliminated in 1987.</p>
			<p>The election of Labor's Duncan Kerr in 1987 proved a watershed, as he held the seat on double-digit margins from 1993 through to his retirement in 2010. Andrew Wilkie then gained the seat after outpolling the Greens with 22.6% of the primary vote, then progressively overtaking the Liberals and Labor as preferences were distributed. He has increased both his primary vote and two-party margin over Labor at each of the three elections since, securing a primary vote majority for the first time in 2019.</p>

			<p>Clark encompasses Hobart on the western side of the Derwent River, with the city's eastern shore suburbs and southern outskirts accommodated by Franklin. The electorate recorded the nation's seventh highest response for &#8220;no religion&#8221; or &#8220;secular&#8221; in the 2016 census, a measure that correlates with green-left sensibilities.</p>
			<p>Like all of Tasmania's electorates, Clark and its earlier incarnation of Denison have changed little since Tasmania was first divided into single-member electorates in 1903, owing to the state's representation being set consistently at the constitutional minimum of five seats. Since Tasmania's population would otherwise warrant only three, the five Tasmanian seats are distinguished by enrolments of around three-quarters the national average.</p>

		<candidates>
			<p>Independent member <b>Andrew Wilkie</b> first came to national attention in 2003, when he resigned as an intelligence officer with the Office of National Assessments in protest against the Iraq war. Wilkie ran against John Howard as the Greens candidate for Bennelong in 2004, and as the second candidate on the party's Tasmanian Senate ticket in 2007. He then broke ranks to run as an independent in Denison at the 2010 state election, falling narrowly short of winning one of the five seats with 9.0% of the vote.</p>
			<p>His breakthrough came at the federal election later that year, when he gained Denison upon the retirement of Labor member Duncan Kerr. This left him as one of five cross-benchers in the first hung parliament since the Second World War. He initially declared himself open to negotiation with both parties, which the Liberals took seriously enough to offer $1 billion to rebuild Royal Hobart Hospital. In becoming the first of the independents to declare his hand for Labor, Wilkie criticised the promise as &#8220;almost reckless&#8221;, prompting suggestions from the Liberals that his approach had been insincere.</p>
			<p>The deal with Labor included what proved to be a politically troublesome promise to legislate for mandatory pre-commitment for poker machines, from which the government retreated after it was able to slightly improve its numbers by persuading Coalition renegade Peter Slipper to take the Speakership. Wilkie responded by withdrawing his formal support for the government, although it never appeared likely that he would use his vote to bring it down.</p>
			<p>Labor's candidate is <b>Simon Davis</b>, a hospitality worker and delegate for the Left faction United Workers Union who polled 3.1% as a candidate for the state electorate last year, the second strongest performance by a candidate on the Labor ticket.

			<p>Covering parts of Hobart's periphery and hinterland, Franklin has been held by Labor since 1993, and was the only one of the five Tasmanian seats to stay with Labor at the low point of 2013. It has been held since 2007 by Julie Collins, who has built up her margin from 4.5% on debut to a peak of 12.2% in 2019.</p>
			<p>Franklin leaned conservative through most of a history going back to 1903, and was held for the Liberals by Bruce Goodluck from 1975 until the party's poor result in Tasmania in 1993. It was then held for Labor until 2007 by Harry Quick, who saw off a threat to his preselection in 2004 partly by threatening to run as an independent.</p>
			<p>Quick chose his own time of departure in 2007, initiating a messy preselection process that originally turned up Kevin Harkins, state secretary of the Left faction Electrical Trades Union. This prompted Quick to denounce Harkins as a &#8220;right thuggish bastard&#8221; who would lose the seat, and declare he would vote for the Greens. Harkins succumbed to pressure to withdraw after the Australian Building and Construction Commission brought charges against him over an illegal strike, and he would later have his Senate preselection for 2010 overturned by the intervention of Kevin Rudd.</p>
			<p>Julie Collins was anointed as Harry Quick's successor by Labor's national executive after Harkins withdrew, and retained the seat in the face of a 3.1% swing to the Liberals, one of only four such swings in the country at the 2007 election. Collins went on to enjoy a 6.8% swing off this suppressed base in 2010, the party's second strongest result of the election, leaving more than enough fat for her to survive a 5.7% swing to the Liberals in 2013. She has since had successive swings in her favour of 5.6% in 2016 and 1.5% in 2019.</p>

			<p>Collins progressed from parliamentary secretary after the 2010 election to the outer ministry in December 2011, and then to cabinet as Housing and Community Services Minister after she backed Kevin Rudd's successful leadership challenge in June 2013.

		<background>
			<p>Central Tasmanian seat that Labor comfortably retained in 2019 after a troubled Liberal campaign, in contrast to the party's defeats in neighbouring Bass and Braddon. It has become somewhat stronger for Labor than those seats in recent times, with the Liberals' only win since 1990 coinciding with the election of the Abbott government in 2013.</p>
			<p>Lyons was renamed in 1984 from Wilmot, which was held for Labor from 1946 to 1975 by Gil Duthie, but was otherwise in conservative hands more often than not. Labor's first win was accomplished in 1929 by Joseph Lyons, for whom it would later be renamed, but his association with the party came to a spectacular end when he and his followers joined with the conservatives to form the new United Australia Party in 1931, which he then led to a sweeping election win. Labor narrowly won the by-election for Wilmot after Lyons died in 1939, but Allan Guy recovered it for the UAP in 1940 and retained it in the face of the party's grim result in 1943.</p>
			<p>Gil Duthie unseated Guy in 1946 and retained the seat for Labor through to the Liberals' clean sweep of Tasmania in 1975, which was repeated at the next four elections before Denison fell to Labor in 1987. However, the real landslip in Tasmania came in 1993, when Labor gained Lyons, Franklin and Bass, with Braddon completing a Labor clean sweep in 1998. Dick Adams held Lyons for Labor from 1993 to 2013, when he fell victim to a massive 13.5% swing amid a backlash that also cost Labor Bass and Braddon.</p>
			<p>Liberal member Eric Hutchinson lasted only one term, his 1.2% margin proving insufficient in the face of a 3.5% swing to Labor's Brian Mitchell in 2016. Mitchell's cause at the 2019 election was greatly assisted by the withdrawal of Liberal candidate Jessica Whelan over anti-Muslim comments posted on Facebook, which came too late for her to be removed from the ballot paper. The Liberals encouraged supporters to vote for the Nationals candidate, who received 15.7% of the vote to Whelan's 24.2%. Mitchell's primary vote was down 3.9%, but he gained a 1.2% swing on two-party preferred.</p>

			<p>Aston was then held through to 2010 by Chris Pearce, whose margin reached a peak of 13.2% amid a strong performance for the Liberals in suburban Melbourne in 2004. However, it equally joined many such seats in swinging heavily to Labor in 2007, when an 8.1% swing reduced the margin to 5.1%.</p>
			<p>Pearce's retirement in 2010 raised Labor hopes that the seat might provide a gain to balance expected losses in New South Wales and Queensland, but Liberal candidate Alan Tudge held out against a 3.3% swing by 1.8%.

		<background>
			<p>Ballarat has existed as an electorate since federation, allowing from the technicality that the obsolete spelling of Ballaarat was used until 1977. It changed hands with some regularity over the years, but has become reasonably safe for Labor on the watch on Catherine King, who gained it from the Liberals in 2001.</p>
			<p>The inaugural member for the seat was Alfred Deakin, who held it as a protectionist liberal through three spells as Prime Minister. Charles McGrath gained the seat for Labor when Deakin retired in 1913 and held it until 1931, outside of a brief interruption after Nationalist Party candidate Edwin Kerby won by a solitary vote in 1919. A successful legal challenge against the result led to a by-election in July 1920 at which McGrath comfortably regained the seat.</p>
			<p>McGrath joined the Labor rebels in the 1931 split and retained the seat for the United Australia Party at that year's election, before retiring in 1934. Labor next held the seat from 1937 until the split of 1955, when Bob Joshua joined the break-away anti-communist group. Dudley Erwin gained it for the Liberals at the election later that year with help from Joshua's preferences, and it remained in Liberal hands until 1980.</p>
			<p>Erwin was succeeded in 1975 by Jim Short, who was unseated in 1980 by Labor candidate John Mildren, later to return as a Senator from 1985 to 1997. The seat next changed hands with Labor's statewide rout in 1990, when Michael Ronaldson gained it for the Liberals. Ronaldson held it through to his temporary retirement in 2001, before he too returned as Senator, serving from 2005 to 2016.</p>
			<p>Ballarat was the only seat gained by Labor at the 2001 election, at which the effect of Ronaldson's retirement was compounded by the withdrawal in contentious circumstances of the Liberals' first choice of candidate, Russell Mark. Having gained the seat with a 5.5% swing, Catherine King has achieved further swings at four of the five elections since, the exception being a 6.8% swing to the Liberals in 2013 that reduced her margin to 4.9%.</p>

			<p>The city of Ballarat currently lies at the western end of an electorate that also includes Clunes and Daylesford to the north and lightly populated rural territory to the south.

The changes are slightly to Labor's disadvantage, reducing the margin by 0.7%.</p>

			<p>Covering shifting territory in central Victoria since federation, Bendigo has been a marginal seat for most of its history, although it has become relatively secure for Labor in recent times. Current member Lisa Chesters came to the seat in 2013 in succession to Steve Gibbons, who gained it for Labor in 1998.</p>
			<p>Labor first won the seat in 1913, but it returned to the conservative fold when Billy Hughes came to the seat as Prime Minister in the wake of the Labor split of 1917. Hughes had previously held West Sydney for Labor, but recognised he would be unable to retain the seat as an anti-Labor Nationalist candidate. He remained in Ballarat until 1922, when he moved to North Sydney. Labor's only win between 1917 and 1949 came with the election of the Scullin government in 1929, with the seat being held by the United Australia Party from 1931 to 1937 and the Country Party thereafter.</p>
			<p>Bendigo then gained the curious distinction of being held by Labor from the party's election defeat in 1949 until its victory in 1972. The former result was aided by the retirement of Country Party member George Rankin and an exchange of rural territory for Castlemaine and Maryborough in a redistribution. The 1972 result was variously put down to the entry of a popular Country Party candidate, whose preferences aided victorious Liberal candidate John Bourchier, and attacks on Labor member David Kennedy over state aid and his liberal position on abortion.</p>
			<p>Ballarat has since changed hands in 1983, when Bourchier was unseated by future Victorian Premier John Brumby; in 1990, when Brumby wound up on Labor's nine-seat Victorian casualty list; and in 1998, when Steve Gibbons gained the seat for Labor upon the retirement of Liberal member Bruce Reid. Gibbons held the seat on margins ranging from 1.0% in 2004 to 9.5% in 2010, before retiring in 2013. The seat then recorded an 8.2% swing to the Liberals, reducing new Labor candidate Lisa Chesters' margin to 1.3%, which she was able to improve by 2.5% in 2016 and 5.2% in 2019.</p>

			<p>Held for Labor since 2016 by Julian Hill, Bruce has covered a shifting area of Melbourne's outer south-east since it was created in 1955 to accommodate post-war development, with a watershed redistribution in 1996 transforming it from a Liberal to a Labor seat. The latest redistribution has continued a process of migration south-eastwards along the Monash Freeway, which on this occasion has slashed Labor's margin from 14.2% to 7.3%.</p>
			<p>Bruce was held for the Liberals from 1955 to 1983 by Billy Snedden, who led the party from the 1972 election defeat until Malcolm Fraser deposed him in March 1975, before serving through the Fraser years as Speaker. Snedden retired after the 1983 election defeat and was succeeded at a by-election in 1983 by Ken Aldred, who had held the since-abolished eastern suburbs seat of Henty for the Liberals from 1975 until his defeat in 1980.</p>
			<p>Aldred was defeated for Liberal preselection in 1990 by Julian Beale, whose seat of Deakin had been made notionally Labor by redistribution. Aldred then ran for Deakin himself, and was able to retain it for the Liberals on the back of a statewide backlash against Labor. The 1996 redistribution left Beale needing a 1.6% swing to retain his seat, but he was only able to manage half that as Victoria largely resisted the national tide to the Coalition.</p>
			<p>Bruce was then held for Labor by Alan Griffin, who came seeking refuge after the abolition of his Melbourne fringe seat of Corinella, which he gained in 1993 from Liberal member Russell Broadbent, later to return in McMillan (now Monash). Griffin retained the seat on margins ranging from 1.8% in 2013 to 8.3% in 2007, and was succeeded in 2016 by Julian Hill, who has enjoyed successive swings of 2.3% and 0.1%.</p>

			<p>As redrawn by the redistribution, Bruce extends along the Monash Freeway from Dandenong North south-east to Narre Warren, including Endeavour Hills and Narre Warren to its north and Dandenong and Hallam to its south.

			<p>Bruce extended north to Burwood and south to Cranbourne from its creation in 1955 until the redistribution of 1969, when it was drawn westwards into middle suburbia around Mount Waverley. The decisive change in its partisan complexion in 1996 resulted from the exchange of Mount Waverley for Noble Park and Dandenong North. The redistribution before the 2019 election further boosted the margin, from 4.1% to 14.0%, by removing Glen Waverley and Wheelers Hill in the north, accounting for more than half its previous enrolment, and adding Endeavour Hills and western Narre Warren in the east.</p>

It was then held successively for Labor by Race Mathews from 1972 to 1975, who later entered state politics as the member for Oakleigh in 1979; for the Liberals from 1975 to 1983 by Peter Falconer; and for Labor from 1983 to 1984 by Peter Steedman.</p>
			<p>Rob Halverson gained the seat for the Liberals at the 1984 election, when it took only a minor redistribution shift and a small swing to account for a slight existing Labor margin. Halverson held the seat through to 1998, when he was succeeded by Howard government Health Minister Michael Wooldridge, whose position in his existing seat of Chisholm had been weakened by redistribution. Wooldridge retired from politics at the 2001 election and was succeeded by Tony Smith, a former staffer to and close ally of Peter Costello.</p>
			<p>Smith's margin peaked in double digits in 2004, but was reduced to 1.9% going into the 2013 election after successive swings to Labor and an unfavourable redistribution. He was nonetheless comfortably re-elected with a 7.2% margin after a 5.3% swing, which another unfavourable redistribution helped pare back to 4.6% in 2019.</p>

			<p>Casey covers Melbourne's eastern suburban fringe at Lilydale, Kilsyth and Monbulk, together with the Yarra Valley townships of Yarra Glen, Healesville and Warburton and undeveloped Yarra Ranges areas further afield. The suburban end is Liberal-leaning, middle-income and culturally homogenous, with an above-average number of mortgage payers. Outcrops of Labor support further afield coincide with lower incomes at Healesville, a Greens-friendly &#8220;tree-changer&#8221; tendency around Monbulk, and a combination of the two at Warburton.</p>
			<p>The electorate was oriented further to the west when it was created in 1969, extending from Ringwood north to Kinglake. The bulk of the modern electorate remained in La Trobe at that time, until Casey assumed approximately its current dimensions when the enlargement of parliament in 1984 pushed it further east into the Yarra Valley. The latest redistribution has had only a slight impact, adding 1075 votes around Clematis and Avonleigh from La Trobe.</p>

			<p>Eastern Melbourne seat that bore the distinction of being the Liberals' only gain at the 2016 election, and was retained by the party in 2019 despite the victor of 2016, Julia Banks, having quit the party to run unsuccessfully as an independent in Flinders. It has since been held by Gladys Liu, whose 0.5% margin is the smallest of any Liberal other than Bridget Archer in the Tasmanian seat of Bass.</p>
			<p>Chisholm has existed in name since parliament was enlarged in 1949, but it initially encompassed areas further to the west that now bolster the Liberals in Higgins and Kooyong. Redistributions after 1969 drew the electorate eastwards into areas that were accommodated through the era of post-war growth by Deakin, La Trobe and Bruce, making a marginal of what had long been a safe seat for the Liberals. The Liberal grip was loosened by successive swings in 1977 and 1980, before Helen Mayer succeeded on her third attempt as Labor candidate in 1983.</p>
			<p>Michael Wooldridge recovered the seat for the Liberals in 1987, and went on to serve as Health Minister in the early years of the Howard government. He maintained a precarious grip until 1998, when he jumped ship for the safer seat of Casey. Chisholm was won for Labor in his absence by Anna Burke, who went on to serve as Speaker through the Rudd-Gillard government's last year in office. Burke's margin peaked at 7.4% in 2007 before wearing away to 1.6% in 2013.</p>
			<p>Julia Banks accounted for the remaining Labor margin upon Burke's retirement in 2016 with a 2.8% swing. She quit the Liberal Party to sit as an independent in November 2018, having expressed displeasure at the demise of Malcolm Turnbull the previous August, and went on to run a distant third against Greg Hunt in Flinders with 13.8% of the vote. Gladys Liu survived a 2.3% swing to retain the seat for the Liberals in 2019 by a margin of 0.6%, which the latest redistribution has shaved to 0.5%.</p>

			<p>The electorate lies at the centre of a band of suburbs through middle-eastern Melbourne characterised by a large Chinese population, giving it the second highest share of Chinese language speakers after the Sydney seat of Bennelong, with particularly large concentrations in Glen Waverley and Box Hill.

		<background>
			<p>Inner north-eastern Melbourne electorate known prior to 2019 as Batman, which has lately maintained its long-established record as a Labor seat despite a growing challenge from the Greens. The current member, former Australian Council of Trade Unions president Ged Kearney, came to the seat at a by-election in March 2018 after the resignation of David Feeney, one of many victims of the Section 44 parliamentary eligibility crisis. Feeney was unique among those ensnared in not recontesting his seat, the party leadership having made clear its preference for Kearney.</p>
			<p>The Batman electorate was created in 1906, though it was then centred further south around Fitzroy, with the Bourke electorate accommodating what were then Melbourne's northern outskirts. Both Batman and Bourke were won by Labor for the first time with the party's historic 1910 election win, and their grip slipped only twice thereafter: when the United Australia Party held Batman for a term after the 1931 landslide, and when Sam Benson was expelled from the ALP in 1966 over his support for the Vietnam war. Benson was re-elected as an independent in 1966, but the seat reverted to Labor when he retired in 1969.</p>
			<p>The Liberals were last competitive in Batman in 1977, when future Deputy Prime Minister Brian Howe retained it for Labor on his debut by 3.4%. Howe picked up big swings in 1980 and 1983, and was boosted nearly 8% by boundary changes in 1984. He was succeeded in 1996 by Martin Ferguson, a former ACTU president and Left faction powerbroker who emerged as a key opponent of erstwhile factional ally Julia Gillard and a supportive voice for the mining industry.</p>
			<p>Ferguson was succeeded in 2013 by David Feeney, who had previously been a Senator since mid-2008. Despite his influence in the Right, Feeney had been struggling to find a winnable seat as it became clear his existing berth at number three on the Senate ticket was an electoral lost cause, and his accommodation in Batman met with strong resistance from local Left elements.</p>
			<p>Meanwhile, Labor was coming under growing pressure in the seat from the Greens, whose perennial candidate Alex Bhathal outpolled the Liberals to make the final count for the first time in 2010, falling 7.9% short of defeating Ferguson after preferences. The Greens were then dealt a blow when the Liberals directed preferences against them in 2013, allowing Feeney to score a slight two-party swing in his favour despite a 10.6% drop in the Labor primary vote.</p>
			<p>Feeney endured a disastrous election campaign in 2016 in which it was revealed he had failed to declare a negatively geared local property on the register of members' interests. Having barely survived a 9.6% swing by a margin of 1.0%, he was dropped from the outer shadow ministry after the election. His Section 44 issued emerged in December 2017, when he proved unable to offer evidence for his claim to have renounced British and Irish citizenships he held through his father, who was born in Northern Ireland.</p>
			<p>Ged Kearney won the resulting by-election with a favourable swing of 3.4%, gaining 7.9% in the absence of a Liberal candidate and prevailing over the Greens by 4.4% at the final count. She went entirely untroubled in what was now the seat of Cooper in 2019, gaining a 13.4% two-party swing against the Greens compared with the 2016 election result, with the Greens finishing only slightly ahead of the Liberals.</p>

		<background>
			<p>Encompassing the hinterland of Geelong, including Torquay and the Bellarine Peninsula, Corangamite is a once secure Liberal seat that has developed into a marginal, with current member Libby Coker gaining it for Labor in 2019 from two-term Liberal member and now Senator Sarah Henderson. The latest redistribution has cost it much of the Surf Coast and rural territory further inland, with little impact on the margin.</p>
			<p>Corangamite has encompassed territory west of Geelong since federation, with Labor only scoring two wins before 2007: in 1910, when it was won by Jim Scullin, and 1929, when Scullin, now the member for Yarra, led Labor to power. The Country Party held the seat for a term after William Gibson gained it in 1931, before it passed to the United Australia Party when Gibson moved to the Senate in 1934, and then to the Liberals when the party was founded in 1945.</p>
			<p>Urban development around Geelong made Labor increasingly competitive over time, particularly after the enlargement of parliament in 1984 cost the seat conservative rural territory in the west. The watershed came with Darren Cheeseman's win in 2007 over Stewart McArthur, who had held the seat since 1984 and sought re-election despite having turned 70.</p>
			<p>Cheeseman's already narrow margin was pared back to 711 votes in 2010, when the seat was first contested for the Liberals by Sarah Henderson. Henderson succeeded on the second attempt in 2013 with a 4.2% swing, with Cheeseman later returning to politics in 2018 as the state member for South Barwon.</p>
			<p>After winning re-election in the face of a slight swing in 2016, Henderson had her 3.1% margin eliminated after the seat exchanged Geelong suburbs for the Bellarine Peninsula in a redistribution. A 1.1% swing to Labor at the 2019 election was duly sufficient to cost her the seat, interrupting a career that resumed in September 2019, when she filled the Senate vacancy created by Mitch Fifield's appointment as Australian representative to the United Nations.</p>

			<p>Covering most of Geelong since federation, Corio has been held by Labor since 1967, current member Richard Marles having come to the seat in 2007. It had hitherto been a marginal seat, the watershed arriving when Gordon Scholes gained it at a by-election that served as the first electoral test of new Labor leader Gough Whitlam. Scholes held on by 20 votes amid Labor's rout in 1975, eventually bequeathing the seat in 1993 to Gavan O'Connor. Marles came to the seat after defeating O'Connor for preselection, inspiring O'Connor to run against him as an independent, with little success.</p>
			<p>Corio was a bellwether for much of its early existence, changing hands along with government in 1910 (to Labor), 1913 (to Liberal), 1914 (to Labor), 1917 (to the Nationalists), 1929 (to Labor) and 1931 (to the United Australia Party). Labor then gained the seat ahead of schedule at a by-election held in 1940 after Richard Casey was appointed ambassador to the United States, later to return to parliament as member for La Trobe in 1949, a result that played a crucial role in Bob Menzies' defeat on the floor of parliament the following year.</p>
			<p>Cycling hero Hubert Opperman recovered the seat for the Liberals with the party's 1949 election win, going on to serve as Immigration Minister. The seat was unsuccessfully contested for Labor in 1963 by Bob Hawke, and Gough Whitlam encouraged him to do so again when Opperman resigned to take up a diplomatic post in 1967, but he instead preferred to pursue his designs on the presidency of the Australian Council of Trade Unions.</p>

			<p>Marles was quickly promoted to parliamentary secretary in June 2009, but relinquished his position after defecting to the Kevin Rudd camp in February 2012. When Rudd toppled Julia Gillard in June 2013, he was promoted to cabinet as Trade Minister.</p>
			<p>Following Labor's defeat in 2013, Marles served in shadow cabinet in the immigration and border protection portfolios during the first term and defence during the second. He became deputy leader after the 2019 election when Anthony Albanese's rise to the leadership obliged Tanya Plibersek to step aside, in observance of the convention that the leadership positions be divided between Right and Left.

			<p>Eastern Melbourne seat that has been highly marginal for most of its history, although it has brought Labor remarkably little joy, having been won by them only in 1983, 2007 and 2010. It has been held for the Liberals since 2013 by Michael Sukkar, who was elected for a third time in 2019 with a margin of 4.8%, which the latest redistribution has shaved to 4.7%.</p>
			<p>Deakin was created in 1937 and held by the United Australia Party and the Liberals until 1983, with Labor falling just short in 1951 and 1954 and with Gough Whitlam's election wins in 1972 and 1974. Labor finally made it over the line when John Saunderson gained it with the election of the Hawke government in 1983, but Julian Beale recovered it for the Liberals in 1984, when Saunderson moved to the new seat of Aston.</p>
			<p>The seat presented a picture of electoral stability from 1984 to 2001, when Liberal margins ranged only from 0.7% to 2.5%. There was a 4.3% swing to the Liberals amid the statewide wave of 1990, but this served only to negate a redistribution that turned a 1.5% Liberal margin into a notional Labor margin of 1.9%. The redistribution in question led Beale to successfully challenge controversial party colleague Ken Aldred for preselection in Bruce, leaving Aldred to reluctantly accept the consolation prize of Deakin.</p>
			<p>Aldred retained the seat in 1990 and 1993, but was again deposed for preselection in 1996, this time by Phillip Barresi, who went on to hold the seat through the Howard years. Barresi's margin peaked at 5.0% in 2004, but this did not avail him in 2007, when Mike Symon gained the seat for Labor with a 6.4% swing. Barresi attempted to recover the seat in 2010, but a generally strong result for Labor in Victoria was reflected in a 1.0% swing to Symon.</p>
			<p>Symon's margin was cut from 2.4% to 0.6% by a redistribution before the 2013 election, and Michael Sukkar subsequently unseated him with a 3.8% swing. Sukkar added 2.5% to his margin against the trend of the 2016 election and then gained a further 0.9% through redistribution, allowing him to comfortably survive a 1.7% swing to Labor in 2019.</p>

			<p>When created in 1937, Deakin extended far beyond the city limits to Seymour and Mansfield, before gaining a wholly urban orientation in 1969. It assumed roughly its current dimensions when the Box Hill area was transferred out of the electorate in 1977.</p>
			<p>The latest redistribution has redrawn the western boundary to transfer parts of Nunawading and Mitcham to Menzies, accounting for 19% of the electorate's former enrolment, while adding parts of Blackburn, Forest Hill and Nunawading, home to 7% of the former enrolment of Chisholm.

			<p>Dunkley was created with the enlargement of parliament in 1984 and held for Labor until 1990 by Robert Chynoweth, who had won Flinders in 1983, which provided the new seat with most of its territory. Chynoweth was unseated by a 6.8% swing amid Labor's statewide rout in 1990, overwhelming a redistribution that had added 3.9% to his margin. He ran again in 1993 and emerged a surprise winner, unseating one-term Liberal member Frank Ford with a 1.9% swing. His hopes of holding out against the tide in 1996 were effectively scuttled by another redistribution, which left him defending a negative margin.</p>
			<p>The seat was then held for the Liberals through to 2016 by Bruce Billson, who had built up enough of a buffer by the 2004 election to survive swings to Labor of 5.3% in 2007 and 3.0% in 2010.

			<p>Encompassing the Mornington Peninsula and Phillip Island around 75 kilometres south of Melbourne, Flinders is to be vacated at the election with the retirement of Health Minister Greg Hunt, who has held it since 2001. Labor has won the seat on only three occasions through a history going back to federation, the most recent being in 1983. Hunt's margin was reduced to its lowest level in 2019 after successive Labor swings of 4.0% and 1.4%.</p>
			<p>Labor's wins came in 1929, when the then Prime Minister Stanley Bruce was famously unseated; at a by-election in 1952; and with the election of the Hawke government in 1983. The latter result came three months after a by-election at which Peter Reith retained it for the Liberals in the face of a surprisingly mild 2.3% swing, which served as a catalyst for Bill Hayden's demise as Labor leader. The seat had previously been held by Phillip Lynch, who had served as Treasurer from 1975 to December 1977, when he made way for John Howard after a controversy over his use of a family trust to minimise tax.</p>
			<p>Peter Reith recovered the seat at the 1984 election after Labor's victor of 1983, Robert Chynoweth, moved to the new seat of Dunkley. He retained it on generally increasing margins through to 1998, when a 6.3% swing to Labor pared it back 3.7%, and served as a senior minister through the first two terms of the Howard government.</p>
			<p>Greg Hunt succeeded Reith on his retirement in 2001, consolidating the Liberals' hold with successive swings of 3.9% in 2001 and 3.5% in 2004. His margin was dented only slightly amid the statewide movement to Labor in 2007 and 2010, and reached a peak of 11.8% in 2013 before declining at the two elections since. He was challenged in 2019 by Julia Banks, who had won the seat of Chisholm for the Liberals in 2016 but quit the party in late 2018 in the wake of Malcolm Turnbull's demise. Banks managed a modest 13.8% as an independent, finishing a distant third behind Labor.</p>

			<p>Safe Labor seat in western Melbourne, created in 2019 to give effect to the increase in Victoria's representation from 37 seats in 38. The latest redistribution has drawn the electorate into Melbourne's inner west, such that it now shares a boundary with the electorate of Melbourne, boosting the Labor margin by 3.9%.</p>
			<p>The electorate was named in honour of Malcolm Fraser, maintaining the convention that former Prime Ministers give their names to the next new electorate created in their home state after their deaths, Fraser having passed in 2015. The ground was prepared in 2016 by the renaming of the Canberra seat of Fraser, which honoured former Labor MP Jim Fraser, to Fenner.</p>
			<p>After early suggestions the seat might be of interest to Bill Shorten, since it took much of the territory of his existing seat of Maribyrnong, Fraser was contested for Labor by Daniel Mulino, previously a member of the Victorian Legislative Council. While easily elected, Mulino suffered an 8.0% drop on the primary vote that was absorbed by two candidates from the Vietnamese community rather than the Liberals. These included United Australia Party candidate Vinh Van Chau, whose 7.9% vote share from top position on the ballot paper was the party's third best result.</p>

			<p>As redrawn by the redistribution, Fraser encompasses Footscray and Maribyrnong in the east, Sunshine in the centre, and St Albans and western Deer Park and Derrimut in the west. The newly gained area includes southern Footscray and eastern Yarraville, where it absorbs 17% of the former enrolment of Gellibrand, and northern Footscray, Maribyrnong and Maidstone further to the north, where it takes 22% of the enrolment of Maribyrnong. This is balanced by the loss of the area around Taylors Lakes and Keilor at the northern end, where 39% of its former enrolment goes to Gorton.</p>
			<p>The changes largely amount to an exchange of newly developed for established territory, which has a significant impact on its demographic profile, if not its status as a safe Labor seat. It now contains fewer mortgage payers, more persons of Vietnamese ancestry and fewer Italians. The electorate now has the country's second highest share of Buddhists, up from twenty-seventh before the redistribution, and the forty-sixth highest share of Catholics, down from seventh.</p>

It was then held until 1972 by Hector McIvor; from 1972 to 1998 by Ralph Willis, who served as Treasurer in the Keating government from December 1993 through to the election defeat of 1996; and from 1998 to 2013 by Nicola Roxon, who served as Health Minister and then Attorney-General in the Rudd-Gillard government.</p>

The current member is Darren Chester, who came to the seat in June 2008 after the retirement of Howard government minister Peter McGauran, who had held it since 1983.</p>
			<p>McGauran was the first member of the Howard government to leave parliament after the 2007 election defeat, resulting in a three-cornered by-election contest in which Chester comfortably outpolled the Liberals and prevailed over Labor with 6.1% two-party swing, fuelled by particularly heavy swings in the Latrobe Valley. This was a surprisingly poor result for Labor given the strength of the Rudd government's polling at the time, which was widely attributed to the Rudd government's &#8220;alcopops tax&#8221; and local concern over an emissions trading scheme.</p>
			<p>Chester's margin blew out after successive favourable swings over the next three elections, reaching a peak of 18.4% in 2016. It was then pared back by 0.3% in a redistribution and 1.4% by a swing to Labor in 2019.</p>

			<p>The Nationals' position appeared to be jeopardised when the Latrobe Valley centres of Morwell and Traralgon were added to the electorate in 2004, but these areas have since weakened for Labor amid the decline of the local electricity industry and the impact of climate change politics.

Taken together with Balaclava, which it superseded in 1984, the electorate has been held by the dominant conservative party of the time since the two-party system solidified in 1910.</p>
			<p>Balaclava and then Goldstein were held from 1974 to 1990 by Ian Macphee, a leading figure of the party's moderate tendency, then identified as the &#8220;wets&#8221;.

			<p>Kemp served in cabinet in the education and environment portfolios from October 1997 until his retirement in 2004, when he was succeeded by Andrew Robb, former executive director of the National Farmers Federation and federal director of the Liberal Party.

			<p>The electorate's predecessor seat, Balaclava, was created in name at federation, but its centre of gravity drifted south over time from St Kilda to Brighton. Other parts of today's Goldstein were covered by Liberal-held Higinbotham from 1949 to 1969 and marginal Henty from 1969 to 1990.</p>

			<p>The electorate has been significantly affected by the creation of the new seat of Hawke to its west in the latest redistribution, exchanging Melton on the western edge of the metropolitan area for suburbs to the west of Melbourne Airport. The changes have reduced the Labor margin from 15.4% to 14.2%.</p>
		</background>

			<p>As redrawn by the redistribution, Gorton includes newly acquired Taylors Lakes and Keilor at its north-eastern end, adding 39% of the former enrolment of Fraser, while carrying over suburbs from Taylors Hill south through Burnside to western Deer Park and Derrimut, along with lightly developed territory further west. The territory in and around Melton that has been ceded to Hawke, which previously formed the western end of the electorate, accounts for 46% of its former enrolment.</p>
			<p>As an outer suburban growth seat, Gorton is dominated by young families, ranking tenth in the country for mortgage payers. However, this factor has diminished somewhat with the redistribution, which has increased its median income and migrant population.

	<district id="Higgins" name="Higgins">
		<background>
			<p>Located in Melbourne's inner south-east, Higgins is an historically blue-ribbon Liberal seat in which the party came under pressure from both Labor and the Greens in 2019, following the retirement of incumbent Kelly O'Dwyer and displeasure in inner urban areas generally over the demise of Malcolm Turnbull. Katie Allen nonetheless retained the seat with a 3.9% margin over Labor, whose candidate outpolled the Greens by 25.4% to 22.5%.</p>
			<p>Higgins was won on its creation in 1949 by Harold Holt, who had previously served since 1935 as the member for Fawkner, which provided the new electorate with much of its territory and continued to cover Toorak through to its abolition in 1969. Holt served as Prime Minister from January 1966 through to his disappearance in December 1967, after which Higgins was used to parachute John Gorton from the Senate to the House of Representatives to enable him to succeed Holt as leader.</p>
			<p>After being deposed as Prime Minister in March 1971, Gorton remained in Higgins through to 1975, when he indulged in a quixotic bid for one of the Australian Capital Territory's newly acquired Senate seats as an independent. He was succeeded in Higgins by Roger Shipton, who achieved prominence only in 1988, when he stood firm against the late John Elliott's plan to contest the seat at the 1990 election. Shipton stared down Elliott only to lose preselection to Peter Costello, who went on to hold the seat as Treasurer and thwarted prime ministerial hopeful from 1996 to 2007.</p>
			<p>Costello made the surprise announcement that he would not seek the Liberal leadership the morning after the November 2007 election defeat, but lingered in parliament through to late 2009. His retirement resulted in a by-election in December 2009 at which the seat was retained for the Liberals by Kelly O'Dwyer, a National Australia Bank executive and former adviser to Costello, who comfortably defeated high-profile Greens candidate Clive Hamilton. O'Dwyer was elevated to cabinet when Malcolm Turnbull became Prime Minister in September 2015, having contentiously failed to win substantial promotion under Tony Abbott.</p>
			<p>O'Dwyer's retirement at the 2019 election prompted concerns within the party about its hold on the seat, in part due to the rising tide of the Greens, who gained the partly corresponding state seat of Prahran in 2014. Greens candidate Jason Ball comfortably outpolled Labor in Higgins in 2016, while falling 8.0% short at the final count. However, he failed to repeat the feat in 2019, when barrister Fiona McLeod achieved a substantial increase in the Labor primary vote and reduced the Liberal margin to 3.9% off a 6.1% two-party swing.</p>

			<p>Centred around eight kilometres south-east of central Melbourne, Higgins extends from South Yarra at the city end through Toorak, Prahran and Malvern to Glen Iris and Carnegie.

The electorate has the nation's ninth highest median income and its fifth highest rate of high school completion. It recorded a yes vote of 78.3% in the late 2017 same-sex marriage referendum, the seventh highest in the country.</p>
			<p>The redistribution has added Windsor at the western end of the electorate, accounting for 4% of the former enrolment of Macnamara, while transferring part of Glen Iris in the north-east to Kooyong and all of Hughesdale in the south-east to Hotham, respectively accounting for 3% and 4% of the former enrolment of Higgins.

			<p>Holt was won by the winning party from its creation in 1969 until the 1980 election, being held for the Liberals by Leonard Reid from until 1972, for Labor by Max Oldmeadow through to 1975, and for the Liberals by William Yates through to 1980. The watershed arrived when Michael Duffy won the seat for Labor with an 8.7% swing in 1980, thereafter retaining it on mostly double-digit margins through to his retirement in 1996.</p>
			<p>Duffy was succeeded by Hawke-Keating government Foreign Minister Gareth Evans, who had held a seat in the Senate since 1978. Evans announced his intention to resign on the night of the 1998 election defeat, and while this ruffled feathers at the time, it did not cause Anthony Byrne serious trouble as the Labor candidate at the ensuing by-election in November 1999. Byrne's closest shave was a 1.5% margin in 2004, after which he rebounded with a 10.1% swing in 2007, remaining safe thereafter.</p>

		<background>
			<p>Covering a shifting area of Melbourne's south-east since 1969, Hotham was won by Labor for the first time in 1980 and has remained with them ever since. It has been held since 2013 by Clare O'Neil, who has been done a good turn by the electorate's shift southwards in the redistribution, which boosts her margin from 5.9% to 11.2%.</p>
			<p>Hotham was held for the Liberals from its inauguration in 1969 by Don Chipp, who had held its predecessor seat of Higinbotham since 1960. Chipp famously parted ways with the Liberal Party in 1977 to found the Australian Democrats, and was elected that year to the Senate.</p>
			<p>The seat recorded Labor swings of roughly 6% at three successive elections after Chipp's departure, the second of which in 1980 delivered it to Lewis Kent. Kent held the seat through to 1990, when he was unable to defend his preselection after a redistribution weakened the position of his Left faction. He instead settled for the new seat of Corinella on Melbourne's south-eastern fringe, but was unable to carry it amid Labor's poor performance across Victoria.</p>
			<p>The Right's hold on the seat was then inaugurated by Simon Crean, who held it through to his retirement in 2013. Crean held the remarkable distinction of serving on the front bench for all but the final months of a 23-year parliamentary career, which peaked with a stint as Opposition Leader from the November 2001 election defeat to November 2003. He saw off a determined but ultimately anti-climactic preselection challenge ahead of the 2007 election from Martin Pakula, then National Union of Workers state secretary and now a senior minister in Daniel Andrews' state government.</p>
			<p>Crean's tenure as a front-bencher finally ended when he called for a leadership spill to flush out Kevin Rudd in March 2013, offering to serve as his deputy while criticising him for conducting a subterranean campaign against Julia Gillard. The challenge failed to eventuate when Rudd determined it could not succeed, and Gillard dismissed Crean for disloyalty. Crean unsuccessfully stood for the deputy leadership when Rudd finally toppled Gillard in late June, then joined a minor exodus of senior party figures at the election the following September.</p>
			<p>Clare O'Neil suffered a 6.7% swing on debut in 2013, but has retained the seat over three elections on steady margins, despite a redistribution cutting it from 7.5% to 4.2% going into the 2019 election.</p>

			<p>As redrawn by the redistribution, Hotham is centred around Clayton South, 20 kilometres south-east of central Melbourne, extending from Bentleigh East in the west through Clayton in the centre to Springvale and Noble Park in the east. It has been substantially redrawn for the second term in a row, having been reoriented first to the north-east ahead of the 2019 election and now to the south.</p>
			<p>Most of Hotham's newly acquired territory is in the Labor-voting south-eastern corner of the electorate, including Noble Park and Springvale east of Springvale Road, where it gains 35% of the former enrolment of Bruce. It also gains Hughesdale in the north-west, adding 4% from Higgins. The gains are balanced by the loss of the Monash University Clayton campus and electorally marginal territory to its east and north, including Wheelers Hill, Glen Waverley, Mount Waverley and Chadstone south of Waverley Road, where 31% of the former enrolment goes to Chisholm.</p>
			<p>Hotham was created in 1969 as the successor to abolished Higinbotham, which extended west to the bayside at Sandringham, Black Rock and Beaumaris. Higinbotham had been held by the Liberals since its creation in 1960, albeit sometimes precariously. Labor's first win in Hotham in 1980 was assisted by the gain of Springvale and its surrounds, although the party's later ascendancy has been mostly down to demographic change and the party's general statewide dominance.</p>
			<p>Demographically, the boundary changes have produced a less wealthy electorate with an older age profile. The electorate ranks seventh in the country for non-English speakers and second for Greek speakers, concentrated particularly at the western end; fourth for Vietnamese speakers, who predominate in Springvale; and sixth for persons of Indian and Sri Lankan ancestry. There is also a substantial Chinese population, as there is throughout Melbourne's middle-eastern suburbs.</p>

			<p>Indi delivered one of the boilovers of the 2013 election when Sophie Mirabella, Liberal member since 2001 and cabinet minister in waiting, was unseated by Cathy McGowan, a rural affairs consultant who had once worked as a staffer to Ewen Cameron. McGowan prevailed by 439 votes, aided by backing from local activist group Voices for Indi, friction between the coalition parties arising from the contest for Mallee, and perceptions of Mirabella as a Melburnian careerist.</p>
			<p>Mirabella attempted to recover the seat in 2016, but McGowan increased her primary vote from 31.2% to 34.8% and her margin after preferences from 0.2% to 4.8%. The Nationals contested the seat for the first time since 2001, but polled only 17.2% to Mirabella's 27.6%. With McGowan retiring at the 2019 election, Voices for Indi endorsed Helen Haines, who almost matched McGowan in polling 32.4% of the primary vote. The Liberal vote was up 7.3% to 35.1%, but as this was at the expense of the Nationals, who fell to 9.4%, it translated into an insufficient 4.1% improvement at the final count.</p>

			<p>Bayside southern Melbourne seat that has been held by Labor since a favourable redistribution in 1996, current member Mark Dreyfus having come to the seat in 2007. Dreyfus has picked up swings at four of his five elections, the substantial exception being 2013, which brought his margin from a peak of 11.0% to a trough of 3.9%.</p>
			<p>Redistributions have left a strong mark on Isaacs' history, although the one completed last year has left it undisturbed. The presence or absence of Beaumaris at the northern bayside end has been the decisive factor in the Liberals' competitiveness, notably between 1969 and 1977, when Labor's only win came in 1974. David Charles gained the seat for Labor in 1980 and retained it through to 1990, despite Beaumaris being returned to the electorate in 1984.</p>
			<p>Isaacs was won for the Liberals in 1990 as one of the party's nine gains in Victoria by Rod Atkinson, who retained it through to 1996, when a redistribution turned his 3.0% margin into a 3.9% Labor margin through an exchange of Beaumaris for Chelsea and Cranbourne. Greg Wilton held out against Atkinson by limiting the Liberal swing to 2.3%, and added a further 4.8% to his margin in 1998. Wilton committed suicide in June 2000 following widely publicised domestic troubles, which did much to embitter his friend Mark Latham towards then Labor leader Kim Beazley.</p>
			<p>The resulting by-election was won for Labor without Liberal competition by Ann Corcoran, who went on to suffer adverse swings of 3.6% in 2001 and 5.1% in 2004. She held out on the latter occasion due to an exchange of Cranbourne for Noble Park in a redistribution, boosting her margin by 3.8%. Corcoran's weak electoral performance, factional non-alignment and failure to win promotion contributed to her preselection defeat at the hands of Mark Dreyfus ahead of the 2007 election.</p>

		<background>
			<p>North-eastern Melbourne seat that Labor has held since its creation with the enlargement of parliament in 1984, by margins ranging from 2.6% in 1990 to 11.5% in 2010. Kate Thwaites became the member at the 2019 election in succession to Jenny Macklin, who had held it since 1996. Thwaites was elected with a 6.6% margin after a swing in her favour of 1.0%, which the latest redistribution has pared back by 0.7%.</p>
			<p>Jagajaga was largely the successor to abolished Diamond Valley, though with less of the semi-rural orientation that helped make the latter a marginal bellwether through its existence from 1969 to 1984. Peter Staples narrowly won Diamond Valley for Labor in 1983 from Liberal member Neil Brown, who later returned in Menzies in 1984. Staples found an accommodating new home in Jagajaga in 1984, which had a notional Labor margin of 8.4% on creation, and held it through to his retirement in 1996.</p>
			<p>Staples was succeeded by Jenny Macklin, who was elected with a 2.7% margin in 1996 and consolidated with favourable swings in 1998, 2007 and 2010. Macklin served as Labor's deputy leader from the 2001 election until December 2006, and was Family and Community Services Minister through Labor's period in government from 2007 to 2013.</p>

			<p>Jagajaga extends from Heidelberg and Ivanhoe in the south through Greensborough in the centre to Eltham and semi-rural Kangaroo Ground in the east. The latest redistribution has largely reversed that conducted before the 2019 election, restoring the area from Eltham through to Kangaroo Ground, which had accounted for 17% of the enrolment of Menzies, and returning Plenty, Diamond Creek and Wattle Glen to McEwen in the north, home to 12% of the former enrolment of Jagajaga. This amounts to an exchange of one area of fringe suburban and semi-rural territory for another, with a duly modest impact on the margin.</p>
			<p>Before Jagajaga's creation in 1984, its area was progressively covered by Bourke from federation until 1926, which further encompassed Brunswick and Reservoir; Flinders and Indi from 1922 to 1937, which respectively covered outer eastern Melbourne and the state's eastern interior; and Deakin from 1937 to 1949. Ivanhoe was then absorbed by Batman, with the eastern end of today's electorate remaining with Deakin through to 1969, when it was transferred to the new seat of Diamond Valley. Jagajaga originally extended north to Bundoora when it was created in place of Diamond Valley in 1984, its present configuration largely being adopted in 1996.</p>

	<district id="Kooyong" name="Kooyong">
		<background>
			<p>Traditional blue-ribbon seat in Melbourne's inner east, held for the Liberals since 2007 by Morrison government Treasurer Josh Frydenberg. Reflecting a national trend in wealthy inner urban seats, the Liberals' performance in 2019 was their weakest since the party was founded in 1945, with their primary vote falling below 50% for the first time since 1972.</p>
			<p>Kooyong has been held by the prevailing conservative party of the day since federation, most famously through Robert Menzies' tenure from 1934 to 1966. The only complication was John Latham's win as an independent in 1922, when he ran in opposition to the prime ministership of Billy Hughes. With that end accomplished, Latham joined the Nationalists the following year, going on to lead the party after its defeat in 1929. Latham agreed to serve as deputy to Joseph Lyons when he led Labor defectors into a merger with conservative forces as the United Australia Party in 1931.</p>
			<p>Robert Menzies succeeded Latham after he was appointed Chief Justice of the High Court in 1934, having previously been a state MP since 1928 and Deputy Premier since 1932. Menzies ascended to the prime ministership after Lyons' death in April 1939, serving two years as wartime leader before resigning in August 1941, having lost the support of his cabinet colleagues. He returned to prominence as Opposition Leader in the wake of Labor's landslide win in 1943, united fragmented conservative forces under the Liberal Party banner in 1945, and served a record second tenure as Prime Minister from 1949 to 1966.</p>
			<p>Menzies was succeeded in Kooyong by Andrew Peacock, who served as a senior minister in Malcolm Fraser's government and made three unsuccessful attempts to become Prime Minister, first by challenging Fraser for the Liberal leadership in 1981, and later by leading the party to defeat in 1984 and 1990 during two separate stints as Opposition Leader. Peacock resigned mid-term in 1994 and was succeeded at a by-election by Petro Georgiou, who did not rise to the heights of his predecessors, instead developing into a thorn in the side of the Howard government through his liberal views on asylum seekers.</p>
			<p>Josh Frydenberg succeeded Georgiou on his retirement in 2010 and built up his margin over his first three elections from 7.5% to 13.3%. The 8.2% slump in his primary vote in 2019 reflected competition both from Greens candidate Julian Burnside and independent Oliver Yates, former chief executive of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, who polled 9.0%. Burnside finished 5.7% short of Frydenberg at the final count, and 	
			Frydenberg's two-party margin against Labor was cut from 12.8% to 6.7%, Labor's best result in two-party terms since 1929.</p>

			<p>Kooyong is centred around ten kilometres east of central Melbourne, encompassing Kew and Hawthorn in the west, Balwyn and Camberwell in the centre and Mont Albert in the east. It has gained two small areas to the south-east in the latest redistribution, absorbing parts of Surrey Hills from Chisholm and Glen Iris from Higgins, both accounting for around 3000 voters. The electorate is proverbial for its affluence, claiming the highest median income in Melbourne (in a close contest with Goldstein and Higgins) and the seventh highest in the country.</p>

A former director of global banking at Deutsche Bank and adviser to Alexander Downer and John Howard, Frydenberg first sought preselection in Kooyong by challenging Petro Georgiou in 2007.</p>
			<p>With Georgiou's retirement in 2010, Frydenberg won decisive backing from the Michael Kroger faction, while rivals associated with then state Opposition Leader Ted Baillieu backed industrial relations lawyer John Pesutto, who later served as state member for Hawthorn from 2014 until his unexpected defeat in 2018.</p>
			<p>Following the election of the Coalition government in 2013, Frydenberg progressed from parliamentary secretary to outer ministry to cabinet status in February 2016. He served in the resources, energy and northern Australia portfolio before the July 2016 election, and environment and energy after.</p>
			<p>Frydenberg supported Tony Abbott during Malcolm Turnbull's successful leadership challenge in September 2015, then lined up against Peter Dutton in support of both Malcolm Turnbull and Scott Morrison during the August 2018 leadership crisis.

		<background>
			<p>Outer eastern Melbourne seat that has been a pivotal marginal since Labor's first win in 1972, although current member Jason Wood has been able to hold it for the Liberals for all but one term since 2004. Wood's cause has been boosted in recent years by two successive redistributions that expanded the electorate beyond the metropolitan fringe, which along with a 1.3% swing in 2019 have boosted his margin from 1.5% in 2016 to its present 5.1%.</p>
			<p>La Trobe was won for the Liberals on its inauguration in 1949 by Richard Casey, former ambassador to the United States and Governor of Bengal, who was making a return to politics after earlier holding Corio from 1931 to 1940. Casey was a senior minister during both his parliamentary tenures, and ultimately served as Governor-General from 1965 to 1969. John Jess succeeded Casey in 1960 and held the seat through to the election of the Whitlam government in 1972, when he was unseated by Labor's Tony Lamb with a 10.2% swing.</p>
			<p>Lamb comfortably retained the seat in 1974, before succumbing to an 8.9% swing when Marshall Baillieu gained it for the Liberals on his second attempt in the 1975 landslide. It next changed hands in 1980, when Baillieu was unseated by Peter Milton, and 1990, when Milton was unseated by Bob Charles as part of the statewide wave that cost Labor nine seats. Charles had a nervous but remarkably stable time of it over the next decade, holding the seat by margins ranging from 1.0% in 1998 to 3.7% in 2001.</p>
			<p>Jason Wood comfortably retained the seat for the Liberals on Charles's retirement in 2004, when it was contested for Labor by Susan Davies, who had held the state seat of Gippsland West as an independent from 1997 to 2002. Wood held on by 0.5% in the face of a 5.8% swing in 2007, but then became the only Coalition member to lose his seat at the 2010 election, falling victim to a 1.4% swing that typified Labor's relatively strong performance in Victoria.</p>
			<p>Labor member Laura Smyth lasted only one term before Wood recovered the seat in 2013 with a 5.7% swing, and then survived a 2.5% swing back to Labor in 2016. Redistribution boosted Wood's margin by 0.9% going into the 2019 election, which he further improved with a 1.3% swing.</p>

			<p>As redrawn by the redistribution, La Trobe encompasses the Princes Highway from eastern Berwick through to Pakenham, where most of the population is concentrated, and beyond to the western Gippsland town of Bunyip. From there it extends north to Emerald and Cockatoo and south to Westernport Bay at Koo Wee Rup. The electorate has the nation's sixth highest share of mortgage payers, and its ninth highest share of children and teenagers.</p>
			<p>The latest redistribution has added 0.6% to the Liberal margin by removing western Berwick and eastern Narre Warren, where 23% of the electorate's former enrolment has been transferred to Bruce, and adding Bunyip, Koo Wee Rup and surrounding rural territory, home to 10% of the former enrolment of Monash. The imbalance between the losses and gains reflects the area's rapid urban development, which has occurred almost entirely over the past two decades.</p>
			<p>At the time of its creation in 1949, La Trobe encompassed territory as far west as Nunawading and Rowville, which were then on Melbourne's outskirts. It gained roughly its present dimensions with the next expansion of parliament in 1984.

The member since 2013 has been Joanne Ryan, who suffered a 10.0% swing on debut before maintaining a steady margin at the two elections thereafter.</p>
			<p>The inaugural Labor member for Lalor was Reg Pollard, who had previously held Ballarat since 1937. Pollard retained the seat on often narrow margins until Labor's landslide defeat in 1966, when it was gained for the Liberals by Mervyn Lee. A redistribution then turned the Liberal margin of 0.7% into a notional Labor margin of 6.1%, prompting Lee to unsuccessfully contest Bendigo in 1969.</p>
			<p>The seat has been safe for Labor ever since, being held successively by Jim Cairns (1969-77), who came to it after the abolition of his inner Melbourne seat of Yarra, and served as Deputy Prime Minister and Treasurer from 1974 until the loans affair cost him both positions in July 1975; Barry Jones (1977-98), who was Science Minister for the first three terms of the Hawke government; and Julia Gillard (1998-2013), whose tenure as Prime Minister ran from June 2010 to June 2013.</p>

			<p>Lalor accommodates the rapidly developing area around Werribee, 30 kilometres west of central Melbourne. Together with Werribee itself, this includes Wyndham Vale, Tarneit and Hoppers Crossing, with the electorate further extending through undeveloped outskirts to its western boundary at Little River. Most of the voters live in developments that emerged over the past three decades, with only central Werribee and Hoppers Crossing having been developed as of the 1980s.</p>
			<p>When created in 1949, Lalor extended well beyond its current boundaries to country centres as far north as Kyneton and Seymour, but post-war growth had drawn it into roughly its current area by 1969. The redistribution before the 2019 election accentuated its focus on Werribee, transferring more than a quarter of its enrolment at Point Cook and Laverton to Gellibrand in the east. The latest redistribution has again redrawn the boundary with Gellibrand, to which it loses 15% of its former enrolment in Point Cook and Truganina while gaining a smaller number of voters at Williams Landing.</p>

			<p>Inner southern Melbourne seat which has been in Labor hands without interruption since 1906, considering it together with Melbourne Ports, as it was known prior to 2019. However, Labor's margins have tended to diminish as the once working-class seat transformed into one of the nation's wealthiest, and the Greens have lately threatened to reduce them to third place. Current member Josh Burns nonetheless retained the seat comfortably in 2019 upon the retirement of Michael Danby, who had held it since 1998.</p>
			<p>Burns is only the sixth member for the seat through more than a century of Labor control, the first four having been James Mathews (1910-31); Ted Holloway (1931-51), a Curtin-Chifley government minister who had unseated Prime Minister Stanley Bruce in Flinders two years earlier; Frank Crean (1951-77), Whitlam government Treasurer and father of future party leader Simon Crean; and Clyde Holding (1977-98), who had led Labor's hapless state opposition from 1967 to 1977.</p>
			<p>Labor's margin hit a low of 2.1% amid the statewide backlash of 1990, and fell still further to 1.4% at Danby's last election in 2016. Greens support progressively increased from 4.7% in 1998 to over 20% after 2010. The primary vote gap between Labor and the Greens reached a low of 27.0% to 23.8% in 2016, before widening to 31.8% to 24.2% in 2019, as the Liberals fell 4.6% on the primary vote and 5.0% on two-party preferred.</p>

It recorded the third highest yes vote in the country in the 2017 same-sex marriage survey, at 82.0%.</p>
			<p>When created at federation, Melbourne Ports extended west beyond the mouth of the Yarra River to encompass Williamstown and its surrounds. This area was removed when Gellibrand was created with the enlargement of parliament in 1949, though Williamstown was restored to Melbourne Ports from 1955 to 1969. Only with the 1969 redistribution did its bayside frontage extend to all of St Kilda and Elwood, which weakened Labor to the extent of giving the seat a notional Liberal margin going into the 1969 election, based on the party's disastrous performance in 1966.</p>

Current member Anne Webster came to the seat in 2019 after the career implosion of her predecessor, Andrew Broad, following revelations he had placed an advertisement on a website with a view to hooking up with younger women. The Nationals vote subsequently fell by more than half, with the Liberals surging and two independents each scoring almost 10%. Webster nonetheless went untroubled, with the Liberal candidate just failing to edge out Labor at the final exclusion in the preference count.</p>
			<p>Webster is only the fifth member in the seat's history, the first three having been Winton Turnbull (1949-72), Peter Fisher (1972-93) and John Forrest (1993-2013). As in 2019, the retirements of sitting members in 1993 and 2013 gave the Liberals an opportunity to contest the seat, and while they reached the final count on both occasions ahead of Labor, they respectively fell short by 0.5% and 6.2%. The state Liberals' determination to field a candidate in 2013 caused considerable friction between the two parties, reportedly motivating some Nationals to aid independent Cathy McGowan's successful campaign in Indi.</p>

			<p>Mallee encompasses the southern bank of the Murray River from the state border near Mildura to Cohuna, and further territory south to Horsham.

The electorate has the typical demographic markers of a rural seat, such as the nation's seventh lowest median income, its fifth lowest rate of high school completion and twelfth highest median age.</p>
			<p>Prior to the creation of Mallee in 1949, the north-western corner of Victoria was accommodated by Wimmera, which continued to coexist with Mallee as its southern neighbour until 1977. Mallee absorbed Horsham at that point, part of a long-term pattern of expansion to balance relative population decline. Whereas Mallee has been held by the National/Country Party throughout its history, Wimmera was held by the Liberals from 1949 to 1958, and by varying stripes of conservative going back to federation.</p>

			<p>Held for Labor by Bill Shorten, Maribyrnong has covered a shifting area around Essendon in Melbourne's inner north-west since 1906. Labor has held the seat since 1969, with Shorten's margins ranging from to 11.2% in 2019 to 16.9% in 2010. Shorten's margin has been cut at two successive redistributions, first by 2.9% going into the 2019 election, and now by 0.9%.</p>
			<p>Labor's hold on Maribyrnong has been interrupted twice since James Fenton first won the seat for the party, the first being when Fenton defected to the United Australia Party in 1931 split. Fenton narrowly won re-election under the new party's banner in 1931, picking up a 23.6% swing to retain his own seat, but he was defeated in 1934 by Labor candidate Arthur Drakeford.</p>
			<p>The second and longer interruption began when the Liberals gained the seat amid the next Labor split in 1955, when ALP (Anti-Communist) preferences helped Phillip Stokes unseat Drakeford by 114 votes. The same scenario played out, with somewhat more comfortable final margins, over three further elections at which the Democratic Labor Party vote exceeded 15%, before Stokes achieved a genuinely decisive win in the 1966 landslide.</p>
			<p>Stokes was finally unseated in 1969 by Moss Cass, who gained enough of a buffer through further swings in 1972 and 1974 to hold out against Labor's lean years of 1975 and 1977. It was thereafter held comfortably by Alan Griffiths from 1983 to 1996, and by Bob Sercombe from 1996 to 2007. Sercombe went quietly at the 2007 election rather than face preselection defeat at the hands of Bill Shorten, who was then national secretary of the Australian Workers Union.</p>

It is distinguished by its large Italian population, particularly around Keilor West and Avondale Heights, ranking third in the country for Italian speakers and first for Catholics.</p>
			<p>The redistribution involves a large gain of territory north-west of the Western Ring Road, much of it taken up by Melbourne Airport, but also including Tullamarine, which adds 11% of the former enrolment of Calwell. Kensington is also gained in the south, adding 7% of the enrolment of Melbourne.</p>
			<p>The gains are balanced by the transfer of all the electorate's territory west of the Maribyrnong River to Fraser, accounting for 22% of its former enrolment. This encompasses northern Footscray, Maribyrnong and Maidstone, an area notable for its Vietnamese and Chinese population, which previously constituted the electorate's south-western corner.</p>

			<p>Maribyrnong has been held for Labor since 2007 by <b>Bill Shorten</b>, a former national secretary of the Australian Workers Union who gained a national reputation as the public face of the Beaconsfield mine disaster rescue effort in April-May 2006. Despite his power within the Victorian Right, Shorten rose only to parliamentary secretary rank during his debut term, reportedly due to mutual suspicion between himself and Kevin Rudd, culminating in his key role in the June 2010 leadership coup.</p>
			<p>Shorten was promoted to the outer ministry after the 2010 election, then to an expanded cabinet by taking on the employment and workplace relations portfolio in December 2011. Nonetheless, his political stocks were generally thought to have been depleted by the travails of Julia Gillard, whom he crucially abandoned in June 2013 to facilitate Kevin Rudd's return. For this he was rewarded with a portfolio swap of financial services and superannuation for education.</p>
			<p>Following the 2013 election defeat, Shorten successfully contested the first leadership ballot under the party's new rules against Anthony Albanese of the Left. With the vote divided evenly between the party membership and the caucus, Albanese proved the clear favourite of the 30,000 members, recording 59.9% of their votes, but Shorten's 55 to 31 win in the party room vote proved narrowly decisive.</p>
			<p>Labor's respectable defeat at the 2016 election did not diminish his stocks, but it was a different story amid the seemingly more promising circumstances of 2019, when the Coalition was unexpectedly returned with a 1.2% swing.

			<p>Northern Melbourne fringe seat that has been held for Labor on variable margins since 2010 by Rob Mitchell. The rapid development of this area has caused frequent adjustments at redistributions, the most recent of which detaches Sunbury to the new seat of Hawke. Perhaps relatedly, it has also been prone to substantial swings, the stable 2019 result being the first exception to the rule since 2001.</p>
			<p>McEwen was held for Labor from its creation with the enlargement of parliament in 1984 by Peter Cleeland, who retained it in 1987 before joining Labor's nine-seat Victorian casualty list in 1990. Fran Bailey then held the seat for the Liberals for a term, before Cleeland recovered it in 1993. Bailey and Cleeland again went head-to-head in 1996, when Cleeland fell victim to an unfavourable redistribution and a modest Liberal swing.</p>
			<p>Bailey's margin built up to 6.4% at the 2004 election, which she needed every bit of to hold out against the Labor wave in 2007. The initial count gave Labor's Rob Mitchell a win by seven votes, but this became a 12-vote margin for Bailey after a recount, and a 27-vote margin after Federal Court rulings on ballot paper formality did not go as Labor hoped when it challenged the result. Bailey retired at the 2010 election, disappointing Liberals who hoped the esteem she gained during that year's bushfire crisis might help the party retain the seat.</p>
			<p>In Bailey's absence, Rob Mitchell gained the seat on his second attempt with a 5.3% swing, despite the Liberals having secured a seemingly strong candidate in Cameron Caine, a Kinglake police officer credited with saving several lives during the bushfire emergency. Mitchell's position appeared secure when the addition of Sunbury to the electorate boosted his margin by 3.9%, but the margin at the 2013 election was slashed to 313 votes by a 9.0% swing to Liberal candidate Donna Petrovich, a former member of the Victorian Legislative Council.</p>
			<p>Mitchell had a much easier time of it in 2016, perhaps assisted by a disastrous campaign for Liberal candidate Chris Jermyn. Another redistribution cut 2.4% from his margin going into the 2019 election, at which the Liberals picked up a 1.0% swing. The latest redistribution has increased the margin by 0.3%.</p>

The preponderance of new development is reflected in the country's fifth highest share of mortgage payers, and above-average shares of children and their forty-something parents.</p>
			<p>The loss of Sunbury in the latest redistribution, which formerly lay in the electorate's south-west, transfers 26% of its former enrolment to the new seat of Hawke.

			<p>Melbourne has been the showpiece of the Greens' inner-city electoral revolution since 2010, when current party leader Adam Bandt achieved its first win in a House of Representatives seat at a general election. The Greens primary vote reached a new peak of 49.3% after a seventh successive increase in 2019. So much has Bandt dominated the left vote in the seat that Labor was reduced to third in 2016 and 2019. The latest redistribution has further increased his two-party margin against the Liberals from 21.8% to 22.6%.</p>
			<p>Melbourne had previously been held by Labor without interruption since 1904, with members including party leader Arthur Calwell (1940-72), Hawke government Immigration Minister Gerry Hand (1983-93) and Rudd government Finance Minister Lindsay Tanner (1993-2010). The Greens' ascent began amid inner-city hostility to Labor's acquiescence in Howard government asylum seeker policies in 2001 and continued amid the collapse in support for the Australian Democrats in 2004.</p>
			<p>The Greens outpolled the Liberals for the first time when Adam Bandt first contested the seat in 2007, scoring 22.8% on the primary vote and falling 4.7% short of unseating Tanner after preferences. Opportunity knocked when Tanner announced his impending retirement hours after the coup against Kevin Rudd in June 2010, which was followed by an 11.4% drop in the Labor vote and a 13.4% increase in Bandt's, translating into a 6.0% winning margin after preferences.</p>
			<p>Bandt achieved an instant national profile as a cross-bencher in a hung parliament, which the events of Labor's second term only served to enhance. His re-election prospects were nonetheless complicated by the Liberals' reversal of their earlier practice of directing preferences against Labor, but the effect was negated at the 2013 election by a further 7.0% increase in his primary vote, followed by further swings in 2016 and 2019.</p>

			<p>Known as McMillan until 2019, this West Gipplsand seat has been held for the Liberals since 2004 by Russell Broadbent, who previously held it from 1996 to 1998 and earlier served in the abolished seat of Corinella from 1990 to 1993. Broadbent's margins have tended to improve over time, though a 5.8% swing to Labor in 2016 was followed by a status quo result in 2019. The latest redistribution has shaved his margin from 7.4% to 6.9%.</p>
			<p>McMillan was consistently oriented around West Gippsland from its creation in 1949, and was held by the Liberals until 1980 outside of a period of National/Country Party control from 1972 to 1975. However, post-war growth in the Latrobe Valley proved advantageous to Labor, who nearly won the seat in 1974 and suffered a relatively mild swing in 1975.</p>
			<p>Labor's breakthrough came when Barry Cunningham gained the seat in 1980 and retained it through to the statewide anti-Labor backlash in 1990, when it was gained for the Liberals by John Riggall. Cunningham scored a surprise win on his comeback attempt in 1993, accounting for a 4.4% margin with a swing of 4.8%.</p>
			<p>Cunningham was again unseated in 1996, this time by a 2.6% swing to Liberal candidate Russell Broadbent. Broadbent had previously held the short-lived seat of Corinella for a term after its creation in 1990, before losing in 1993 to Labor's Alan Griffin, who then moved to Burke when Corinella was abolished in 1996.</p>
			<p>Broadbent experienced the sharp end of life in a marginal seat for a second time in 1998, when 25-year-old Christian Zahra gained McMillan for Labor with a 2.6% swing. Zahra added 2.3% to his margin in the absence of competition from Broadbent in 2001, but the subsequent redistribution made the seat notionally Liberal by transferring the Latrobe Valley centres of Morwell and Traralgon to Gippsland. Facing a comeback bid by Broadbent in 2004, Zahra suffered a 2.1% swing at a time when he needed a 2.9% swing his way, resulting in McMillan changing hands for the fifth time in six elections.</p>
			<p>Broadbent's third stint in parliament has proved more stable than his first two, largely thanks to strong performances in 2007 and 2010, when he suffered only minor swings in the face of a statewide tide to Labor. His margin peaked at 11.8% after a 7.6% swing in 2013.</p>

			<p>Inner northern Melbourne seat that was traditionally safe for Labor, providing Bob Hawke with a home through a parliamentary career from 1980 to 1992, before the Greens emerged as a threat over the past decade. Labor's two-party margin against the Greens was slashed by 10.3% to 4.9% on current member Peter Khalil's debut in 2016, but he recovered in 2019 with a 3.2% swing in his favour.</p>
			<p>Wills was created with the enlargement of parliament in 1949, in place of the broadly similar seat of Bourke. Labor's strength in the area was established early, with Bourke being held by either Labor or socialist independents after 1910. The inaugural member for Wills was Bill Bryson, who won Bourke for Labor in 1943 but lost it to an independent in 1946.</p>
			<p>Bryson was among seven &#8220;groupers&#8221; who were expelled from the Victorian party during the split of 1955, unsuccessfully contesting that year's election as the candidate of the ALP (Anti-Communist), which would shortly evolve into the Democratic Labor Party. The seat was then held for Labor by Gordon Bryant, who went on to serve as Aboriginal Affairs Minister in the Whitlam government.</p>
			<p>With Bryant's retirement in 1980, the seat was used to accommodate Bob Hawke's long-anticipated entry to parliament and rise to the prime ministership three years later. Hawke resigned from parliament immediately after losing the leadership to Paul Keating in December 1991, and voters delivered a rebuff to Labor at the ensuing by-election by electing independent and local football identity Phil Cleary.</p>
			<p>In a foretaste of the recent Section 44 crisis, Cleary's win was voided the following November as his job as a teacher at the time of his nomination constituted &#8220;an office of profit under the Crown&#8221;. However, the imminence of the 1993 election meant no new by-election was required, and Cleary won the seat at the ensuing election by a margin of 2.4%.</p>
			<p>Cleary's position going into the 1996 election was weakened when redistribution pushed the seat westwards, and Labor candidate Kelvin Thomson provided his party with a rare good-news story that election night when he polled 50.0% of the primary vote to prevail over Cleary by 5.8% after preferences. Thomson served a lengthy stint in the shadow ministry from 1997 to 2007, which ended when it emerged he had given a reference to colourful Melbourne identity Tony Mokbel.</p>
			<p>The Greens primary vote increased at five successive elections from 7.7% in 2001 to 30.8% in 2016, before falling back by 4.3% in 2019.

Canning had broadly similar boundaries to Burt's from 1990 until the creation of Hasluck in 2001, in which time it was won by the Liberals only in 1996.</p>

		<background>
			<p>Covering Perth's southern periphery, Canning is a once marginal seat that has been in Liberal hands since the strongest territory for Labor was ceded to the new seat of Hasluck in 2001. The member since September 2015 has been Andrew Hastie, who came to the seat at a by-election held after the death of his predecessor, Don Randall.</p>
			<p>Canning extended deep into the Wheatbelt when it was created with the enlargement of parliament in 1949, and was accordingly held by the Country Party until 1974, barring one term of Liberal control from 1961 to 1963. The Country Party ceased to be competitive after the 1974 election, which the party's state branch contested as the National Alliance in an electorally disastrous joint venture with the Democratic Labor Party.</p>
			<p>Labor first won the seat with the election of the Hawke government in 1983, when Wendy Fatin unseated Liberal member Mel Bungey on her second attempt, having scored consecutive swings of 13.0% and 9.2%. Fatin contested the new seat of Brand when the parliament was enlarged in 1984, which left Canning oriented around Perth's eastern suburbs. George Gear retained Canning for Labor and held it through to the Keating government's defeat in 1996, including after the seat was reoriented southwards with the creation of Pearce in 1990.</p>
			<p>With the defeat of the Keating government in 1996, Canning was gained for the Liberals by Ricky Johnston, who unseated Gear on her fifth attempt after falling short by 244 votes in 1993. Johnston's hard-won success proved short-lived, as Jane Gerick recovered the seat for Labor in 1998. Gerick was in turn defeated in 2001 after an unfavourable redistribution and a small but decisive swing.</p>
			<p>The seat was then held for the Liberals by Don Randall, who had previously held the inner Perth seat of Swan for a term from 1996 to 1998. Randall faced a notable opponent at the 2010 election in Alannah MacTiernan, a past and future state government minister and later the federal member for Perth from 2013 to 2016. MacTiernan achieved a 2.2% swing against the broader electoral tide, but it was insufficient to account for Randall's 4.3% margin.</p>
			<p>Randall gained a 9.6% swing in MacTiernan's absence in 2013, leaving an 11.8% margin when he died at the age of 62 in July 2015. The subsequent by-election was held the following September, five days after Malcolm Turnbull deposed Tony Abbott as Prime Minister, and was won for the Liberals by Andrew Hastie in the face of a 6.5% swing to Labor. Hastie only slightly improved on the by-election result at the 2016 election, before restoring the margin to double digits in 2019.</p>

The northern part of Mandurah was gained from Brand at the 2016 election as compensation for the loss of Armadale and its surrounds, which were transferred to the new seat of Burt.</p>
			<p>Reflecting the area's rapid development, the electorate loses territory in the latest redistribution despite the state's representation being cut from 16 seats to 15. This involves the transfer of the gold mining town of Boddington in the south to O'Connor and Darling Scarp territory in the north to Hasluck, in each case affecting around 1000 voters, with negligible effect on the margin.</p>

		<background>
			<p>Marginal Perth northern suburbs seat that has changed hands four times since its creation in 1984, most recently when Anne Aly gained it for Labor in 2016. The abolition of neighbouring Stirling has caused it to be drawn substantially southwards in the redistribution, though with only a negligible impact on the margin. It will be contested for the Liberals by Vince Connelly, who succeeded Michael Keenan as member for now abolished Stirling in 2019.</p>
			<p>Cowan was created with the enlargement of parliament in 1984 from territory previously accommodated by Stirling and Moore, and was held for Labor by Carolyn Jakobsen on steadily diminishing margins for its first three terms. Jakobsen's survival in 1990 was owed to a redistribution that established the seat's present orientation east of the Mitchell Freeway, prior to which it extended to the ocean at North Beach. Richard Evans gained it for the Liberals in 1993, serving two terms before his defeat in 1998 at the hands of Graeme Edwards, a former state government minister who lost his legs to a land mine while serving in Vietnam.</p>
			<p>Luke Simpkins gained the seat for the Liberals against the national trend when Edwards retired in 2007, adding to the 4.7% swing he achieved on his first attempt in 2004 with a further swing of 2.5%. Simpkins built up his margin to 7.5% in 2013, but this was cut to 4.0% when the electorate's most affluent area around Kingsley and Warwick was transferred to Moore in the west. What remained of the Liberal margin was accounted for in 2016 by a 5.2% swing to Anne Aly, who increased her delicate margin from 0.7% to 0.8% in 2019.</p>

			<p>Cowan covers suburbs inland of the Mitchell Freeway around 10 kilometres north of Perth, from Stirling north through Balcatta to Greenwood in the west, northern Dianella north through Balga to Marangaroo in the centre, and Noranda north to Ballajura and east to Beechboro in the east. The Ballajura end features a large concentration of mortgage-payers, while Balga and Mirrabooka are famously down-market. While not exceptionally multicultural by national standards, it has the highest non-English speaking population of any electorate in Western Australia.</p>
			<p>The northern and eastern parts of the electorate formed the southern end of the old Cowan, from which around 44% of the voters have been transferred to Pearce. The south-western parts, including Balcatta, northern Dianella, Balcatta and Balga, previously accounted for around half the enrolment of Stirling. Northern Morley and Noranda, which account for around 15% of the enrolment, were previously in Perth. The electorate includes some of the strongest areas for Labor in the old Cowan, particularly around Beechboro, while the Stirling areas had a slight collective lean to the Liberals.</p>

		<background>
			<p>Blue-ribbon western Perth seat that was created with the enlargement of parliament in 1949, prior to which Perth was divided in highly variable fashion between the electorates of Perth and Fremantle. The redistribution has caused it to absorb part of abolished Stirling in the north, without changing its complexion as a conservative seat. The only interruption to Liberal control in Curtin came when Allan Rocher quit the party in 1995 and retained the seat as an independent the following year, before succumbing to Julie Bishop in 1998. The current member, Celia Hammond, succeeded Bishop on her retirement in 2019.</p>
			<p>Curtin was held from its inauguration by Paul Hasluck, who unsuccessfully contested the Liberal leadership after Harold Holt's disappearance in December 1967 and retired in 1969 to become Governor-General. His successor, Victor Garland, served as a minister under Billy McMahon and Malcolm Fraser and retired in 1981 to take up the position of High Commissioner to the United Kingdom. This initiated a preselection clash between two Liberal Senators, Allan Rocher and Fred Chaney, in which the success of the former was widely attributed to the desire of powerful figures in the state party to stymie the career of the latter.</p>
			<p>Rocher's breach with the Liberal Party in 1995 followed his preselection defeat at the hands of Ken Court, whose father Sir Charles Court, the then Premier, had been among his supporters in 1981. This was despite public support for Rocher from John Howard, to whom Rocher had been loyal through successive leadership contests. Howard did little to assist Ken Court's election campaign or to dispel the perception that his preselection was owed to controversial party powerbroker Noel Crichton-Browne, another who had been in the Rocher camp in 1981.</p>
			<p>Rocher retained the seat in 1996 after decisively outpolling Labor by 29.3% to 19.8%, finishing the preference distribution 7.3% clear of Court, who had received 39.1% of the primary vote. However, he slumped to third place with 17.7% of the vote in 1998, allowing Julie Bishop to recover the seat for the Liberals with a 13.3% margin over Labor. Bishop's margins tended to increase thereafter, reaching a peak of 20.7% at her last election in 2016.</p>
			<p>Bishop retired at the 2019 election after supporting Malcolm Turnbull through the 2018 leadership crisis and receiving little support to succeed him as leader, including from her Western Australian colleagues. Her successor as Liberal candidate, Celia Hammond, faced a seemingly threatening independent challenge from Louise Stewart, owner of a chain of health care clinics, but she managed only 7.7% after a troubled campaign. The Liberal vote was nonetheless down by 11.3%, and there was a two-party swing to Labor of 6.4%.</p>

It has the fifth highest median income nationally, and comfortably the highest in Western Australia.</p>
			<p>The redistribution has straightforwardly altered Curtin by adding the southern end of its abolished northern neighbour, Stirling, from which it takes northern Scarborough, southern Trigg, the entirety of Karrinyup and southern Gwelup, collectively accounting for around 11% of the enrolment. The changes have only a slight impact on the Liberal margin, which is reduced from 14.3% to 13.9%.</p>

			<p>Covering the northern half of Western Australia and much of the Wheatbelt region inland of Perth, Durack has been held by the Liberals since it was created in 2010 in place of the abolished federation seat of Kalgoorlie, which had long been renowned as the world's largest electorate. The member since 2013 has been Melissa Price, who has served in cabinet from Scott Morrison's ascent to the prime ministership in August 2018 to her demotion after the May 2019 election, and again since July 2021.</p>
			<p>Durack was held in its inaugural term by Barry Haase, who had previously been the member for Kalgoorlie since he unseated Labor-turned-independent member Graeme Campbell in 1998. The Nationals' recent strong performance in the regions at state level encouraged suggestions the party might gain the seat in Haase's absence, but Melissa Price was able to prevail over their candidate by 4.0% at the final count, with some help from Labor's decision to direct preferences to her. The Nationals ran again in 2016 and 2019, but finished a distant third on both occasions.</p>
		</background>
		<profile>
			<p>Durack encompasses territory north of Perth including the Avon Valley and the northern Wheatbelt region, together with the Gascoyne, Pilbara and Kimberley regions that constitute the state's north. The largest population centre is the coastal city of Geraldton, 420 kilometres north of Perth, followed by Karratha and Port Hedland in the Pilbara and Broome in the Kimberley. The electorate has the country's second highest share of indigenous persons after the Northern Territory seat of Lingiari, providing a base of Labor support in an otherwise conservative seat.</p>
			<p>The abolition of Kalgoorlie in 2010 resulted in O'Connor absorbing the city of Kalgoorlie while the remainder went to Durack, which further took the northern Wheatbelt from O'Connor. The latest redistribution draws Durack to the metropolitan boundary by adding the Avon Valley towns of Toodyay, Northam and York and the coast around Lancelin, collectively accounting for 21% of the enrolment. These areas were formerly in Pearce, which has been refashioned as a purely metropolitan electorate. This is balanced by the transfer of a large but lightly populated area of the interior Wheatbelt around Merredin to O'Connor.</p>

			<p>Durack has been held for the Liberals since 2013 by <b>Melissa Price</b>, a former lawyer who had worked in the mining and agriculture sectors.

She was demoted to the outer ministry in the defence industry portfolio after the 2019 election, despite Scott Morrison's insistence she would remain in environment as her performance and profile came under scrutiny during the election campaign.</p>
			<p>Price's cabinet rank was restored in March 2021 without change to her portfolio, a move that boosted the number of women in cabinet to seven at a time when the government was under fire over its handling of sexual assault allegations. She further gained science and technology in October 2021, which had been vacated with Christian Porter's resignation from cabinet.</p>
			<p>Price supported Tony Abbott when Malcolm Turnbull challenged him for the leadership in September 2015, but aligned with Turnbull and Scott Morrison against Peter Dutton in August 2018.

			<p>Forrest was created in 1922 from territory previously covered by Swan, and extended to Albany until O'Connor was created in 1980. The Country Party held the seat from its creation until 1943, but has not done so again since. Labor strung together successive wins in 1943 and 1946 and later made it over the line in 1969, but its fortunes declined in tandem with those of the local logging industry.</p>
			<p>The aberration of 1969 resulted from an unusually large leakage of Democratic Labor Party preferences from the Liberal member, Gorton government External Affairs Minister Gordon Freeth, who had angered the party by downplaying the Soviet threat in the Indian Ocean. The seat reverted to type against the national trend in 1972, and was subsequently held by Peter Drummond until 1987 and Geoff Prosser through to 2007.</p>

However, the dominant population centres are Bunbury, which has grown increasingly conservative at federal elections, and Busselton, which has long been so, with beef and dairying country accounting for the remainder.</p>
			<p>Reflecting population growth in the region, the electorate has lost rather than gained territory with the redistribution, despite the state's representation being cut from 16 to 15.

			<p>Held by Labor without interruption since 1934, Fremantle was the party's last remaining seat in Western Australia through the successive disasters of 1975 and 1977, and one of three retained in 2010 and 2013. It has been held since 2016 by Josh Wilson on margins of between 4.8% and 7.5%, not counting the by-election he was required to contest in July 2018 after being disqualified during the Section 44 crisis, in which the Liberals did not field a candidate.</p>
			<p>Fremantle has existed since federation, although it accounted for fully half the Perth metropolitan area until 1949. John Curtin held the seat for Labor from 1928 to 1945, outside of a term from 1931 to 1934 when he was unseated by United Australia Party candidate William Watson, who had earlier held it as an independent from 1922 until his defeat by Curtin in 1928.</p>
			<p>Curtin succeeded Jim Scullin as Labor leader a year after his parliamentary comeback in 1934, although he was again run close in Fremantle in 1940. His popularity as wartime Prime Minister from October 1941 powered a 19% swing in 1943, and he became only the second prime minister to die in office in July 1945.</p>
			<p>The seat was subsequently held for Labor by Kim Beazley Sr, who eventually served as Education Minister in the Whitlam government, until 1977; John Dawkins, Treasurer in the Keating government, through to 1994; former Premier Carmen Lawrence, who picked up a rare pro-government swing in the by-election following Dawkins' retirement and held the seat until 2007; and Melissa Parke, a former United Nations human rights lawyer.</p>
			<p>After succeeding Parke at the 2016 election, Josh Wilson's dual British citizenship caused him to fall foul of the black letter of Section 44 of the Constitution, resulting in Fremantle being the scene of one of the five &#8220;Super Saturday&#8221; by-elections of July 28, 2018. Wilson went wholly undisturbed, polling 52.6% of the primary vote amid a forfeit by the Liberals.</p>

			<p>Fremantle encompasses coastal southern Perth from North Fremantle to Henderson and extends inland at its southern end to Jandakot and Banjup, a state of affairs that has not been disturbed by the latest redistribution. A concentration of Greens support around the town of Fremantle allowed the party to win the state seat at a by-election in 2009, but this has never threatened to translate federally, since the party is considerably weaker in the southern areas beyond the state electorate's boundaries.</p>
			<p>While Fremantle has existed in name since federation, it was a very different entity before 1949, when the entire Perth metropolitan area was divided between Perth and Fremantle. The port city would not dominate the electorate to the extent of making it safe for Labor until the enlargement of parliament in 1949, when Curtin was created and Swan reconstituted as a metropolitan seat.</p>

			<p>The short notice for Wilson's candidacy lay at the heart of his Section 44 troubles, as his renunciation of his British citizenship was not registered until the formal election period had begun.

Wyatt's margin reached a new peak of 5.2% in 2019, and has been boosted by further 0.5% in the redistribution.</p>
			<p>Hasluck was held for Labor through two non-consecutive terms by Sharryn Jackson, who won the seat by 1.8% on its inauguration in 2001, lost it to Liberal candidate Stuart Henry by the same margin in 2004 and recovered it by 1.3% in 2007, when Labor gained Hasluck while losing the other Perth seats of Swan and Cowan. Jackson had resisted urgings by her backers to succeed Kim Beazley in Brand when he retired in 2007, instead preferring another tilt at her old seat.</p>
			<p>Jackson was unseated for a second time in 2010, when her 1.3% margin was accounted for by a 0.4% shift in a redistribution and a 1.4% swing to the Liberals. Ken Wyatt strengthened his hold with a further 4.3% swing in 2013, then had his margin increased from 4.9% to 6.0% when largely Labor-leaning territory south of the Canning River, including Thornlie and Gosnells, was transferred to the new seat of Burt. This gave him enough fat to survive a 4.0% swing back to Labor at the 2016 election, followed by a 3.2% swing the other way in 2019.</p>

			<p>The area gained from Pearce has developed almost entirely over the past two decades, and accounts for around a third of the electorate's enrolment. It is balanced by the loss of a large spur that jutted into Perth's south-eastern suburbs as far as the Canning River, starting with Maida Vale, Forrestfield and Wattle Grove, where around 16% of the old Hasluck's enrolment has been transferred to Swan, and continuing to Beckenham, Kenwick and Maddington, where around 14% goes to Burt.

			<p>Northern Perth seat that has become increasingly secure for the Liberals since last changing hands in 1990. The member since 2013 has been Ian Goodenough, who has retained margins of between 11% and 12% at each of his three elections. The latest redistribution extends it southwards into the former territory of abolished Stirling, with negligible impact on the margin.</p>
			<p>Moore had a largely rural orientation when created in 1949, and was held by the Country Party for all but one term through to 1974, except after a solitary Liberal win in 1958. The turning point came when the Country Party lost both its seats in Western Australia after the state branch entered into a poorly received &#8220;National Alliance&#8221; with the Democratic Labor Party. This allowed Liberal candidate John Hyde, noted as an intellectual figurehead of the &#8220;New Right&#8220; (and also for having lost his right arm in a farming accident), to unseat Donald Maisey, who had held it since 1963.</p>
			<p>The only period of Labor control came when Allen Blanchard gained the seat amid Bob Hawke's sweep of the mortgage belt in 1983 and retained it through to 1990. A redistribution then loosened Labor's grip by transferring its non-metropolitan territory to O'Connor and the new seat of Pearce, turning Blanchard's 5.2% margin into a notional Liberal margin of 0.3%.</p>
			<p>The seat was then held for the Liberals by Paul Filing, who went on to retain it as an independent in 1996 after losing preselection to Paul Stevenage. This was widely portrayed as a power play by party numbers man Noel Crichton-Browne, though the truth was more prosaic. A similar story played out in Curtin, where Allan Rocher retained his seat after losing preselection to Ken Court, brother of then Premier Richard Court. Both Filing and Rocher were aided by a lack of campaign support for the Liberal candidates from John Howard, who had opposed the challenges to their preselection.</p>
			<p>After flirting with running as the One Nation candidate, Filing was defeated at the 1998 election by Liberal candidate Mal Washer, a self-described progressive. Washer comfortably retained the seat until his retirement in 2013, when he was succeeded by the rather more conservative Ian Goodenough.</p>

			<p>Covering regional southern Western Australia, O'Connor has been a safe conservative seat since its creation in 1980, the only interruption to Liberal control being when Tony Crook won it for the Nationals in 2010. It was recovered for the Liberals by the current member, Rick Wilson, when Crook declined to recontest in 2013.</p>
			<p>The inaugural member for O'Connor was Liberal firebrand Wilson Tuckey, who owed his &#8220;Ironbar&#8221; nickname to an assault conviction over an incident involving a length of steel cable and an Aboriginal patron of his Carnarvon hotel. Tuckey held the seat through to his defeat in 2010, at which time he was 75 and increasingly considered an erratic figure. Tony Crook prevailed over Tuckey by 3.6% due to a strong flow of preferences, having trailed 38.4% to 28.9% on the primary vote.</p>
			<p>Crook's election situated him as a formally non-aligned member in a hung parliament, the WA Nationals having campaigned as an independent entity that would not &#8220;report, answer and take direction from&#8221; the federal leadership. However, few were surprised when, after a fortnight of prevarication, he announced he would support the Coalition on confidence and supply. Crook bowed out at the 2013 election, complaining of the demands of travel between Western Australia and Canberra.</p>
			<p>After narrowly prevailing over Nationals candidate Chub Witham in 2013, Rick Wilson went untroubled as the Nationals fell to third place in 2016 and 2019. One Nation entered the field in 2019 and polled 8.4%, which was matched by a further decline in the Nationals vote.</p>

			<p>O'Connor covers rural and remote areas in the south of Western Australia, the major population centres being the historic gold mining city of Kalgoorlie and Albany on the south coast. It also accommodates the southern Wheatbelt, the declining logging region around Manjimup and a vast remote area in the east. Kalgoorlie and the surrounding Goldfields region were gained when the Kalgoorlie electorate was abolished in 2016, which was balanced by the loss of the northern Wheatbelt to Durack.</p>
			<p>Three areas have been added to the electorate in the latest redistribution, the most significant of which consists of interior Wheatbelt territory including Merredin and the adjoining Shire of Beverley, respectively from Durack and Pearce, accounting for around 9% of the electorate's enrolment. Smaller numbers of voters are added from the Shire of Boddington to the south-east of Perth and the Shire of Nannup in the South West region, which were respectively in Canning and Forrest. The changes have cut the Liberal margin over Labor from 14.8% to 13.5%.</p>

		<background>
			<p>Northern Perth seat that the Liberals have held since its creation in 1990, but which now looms as a flashpoint for the party after an unfavourable redistribution and the retirement after a troubled term of Christian Porter. Porter came to the seat after a career in state politics in 2013 and held a 7.5% margin at the 2019 election, which has now been cut to 5.2% through the loss of substantial territories beyond the metropolitan area.</p>
			<p>Pearce was won on its inauguration by Fred Chaney, who had served in the Senate since 1974 and as a Fraser government minister and deputy Liberal leader during Andrew Peacock's second leadership stint from 1989 to 1990. Chaney's ambition to move to the House of Representatives went back to 1981, when powerful foes in the state party stymied his preselection bid in Curtin.</p>
			<p>Chaney retired in 1993 and was succeeded by Judi Moylan, who served as a junior minister during the first 18 months of the Howard government and later became a progressive critic of many of its policies. Porter came to the seat on Moylan's retirement in 2013 and held the seat by 8.1% after a small swing to Labor against the trend. A further 5.7% swing brought the rapidly developing seat on to Labor's radar in 2016, but it was followed by a 3.9% move the other way in 2019.</p>
			<p>Porter's career hit turbulence in March 2021 when the ABC reported a woman who had committed suicide the previous year had accused an unidentified cabinet minister of raping her when he was 17 and she 16. Porter acknowledged he was the minister in question but denied the allegation, and sued the ABC and journalist Louise Milligan for defamation. He withdrew the action the following May, with the ABC agreeing to pay mediation costs, and resigned from cabinet the following September after an interest declaration in parliament revealed the action had been partly funded by an anonymous donor.</p>

			<p>Following changes in the redistribution that have cost it slightly more than half the voters from its old boundaries, Pearce encompasses Perth's northernmost coastal suburbs and the suburban corridor around Wanneroo inland of Lake Joondalup. This area accounts for much of Perth's recent urban development, reflected in the nation's highest share of mortgage payers and fifth highest share of children under ten. It ranks fourth in the country for technicians and trades workers, and has the highest share of the workforce employed in the construction industry.</p>
			<p>The redistribution places Pearce entirely within the Perth metropolitan area for the first time, and further entails the exchange of one northern urban centre in Ellenbrook for another in Wanneroo. Whereas the latter is electorally neutral, the loss of the strongly conservative country areas has weakened the Liberals' position. </p>
			<p>The area gained in the redistribution accounts for 44% of the enrolment of the old Cowan, encompassing two areas separated by the Wangara light industrial zone: to the south, the recent development of Madeley, Darch and Landsdale; to the north, established Wanneroo and newly developed suburbia surrounding it, including Hocking and Pearsall in the south and Tapping, Ashby and Sinagra in the north.</p>
			<p>The majority of the old electorate's land mass has been transferred to Durack, which gains 20% of its enrolment from an area encompassing the coast north to Lancelin and the Avon Valley towns of Toodyay, Northam and York. The southern end of the Avon Valley, at Beverley, has been transferred to O'Connor. Within the metropolitan area, the Swan Valley from West Swan north to recently developed Ellenbrook and Aveley has been transferred to Hasluck, accounting for 30% of the former enrolment of Pearce.</p>

			<p>Encompassing central Perth and variable surrounding territory since federation, Perth has been held by Labor since 1983 and was one of three seats left to the party in Western Australia after the 2010 and 2013 elections. The seat has gone through three members since the retirement of Stephen Smith in 2013, the most of recent of whom is Patrick Gorman, who came to the seat in the only one of the five &#8220;Super Saturday&#8221; by-elections of July 2018 that was not a result of the Section 44 crisis. The latest redistribution has cut Gorman's margin from 4.9% to 3.2%.</p>
			<p>Perth was held from its inauguration until 1922 by James Fowler, first for Labor and then as a Liberal and Nationalist after his defection from the party in 1909. It remained in conservative hands until John Curtin's wartime landslide of 1943, when it was gained for Labor by Tom Burke, father of future Premier Brian Burke. Burke was defeated in 1955 by Liberal candidate Fred Chaney Sr, whose son Fred Chaney Jr would later become a Fraser government minister, Senator and member for Pearce.</p>
			<p>The seat was next won by Labor in 1969 by Joe Berinson, a junior minister in the Whitlam government and later a state Attorney-General. Berinson was narrowly defeated by Liberal candidate Ross McLean in 1975, when Labor lost all its seats in the state except Fremantle. Australian hockey captain Ric Charlesworth was able to gain and hold the seat for Labor on tougher boundaries from 1983 to 1993, eventually bequeathing a solid margin to Stephen Smith, who served as Foreign Minister and Defence Minister in the Rudd-Gillard government.</p>
			<p>Smith retired in 2013 and was succeeded by Alannah MacTiernan, a former state government minister who made a creditable but unsuccessful run for the Liberal-held seat of Canning in 2010 and then became the mayor of the inner-city municipality of Vincent. A swing against her in Perth of 1.5% was well in line with the statewide result, suggesting her own personal vote was sufficient to cancel out the loss of Smith's. She did not seek a second term in Perth, instead returning to state politics with the election of the McGowan government in 2017.</p>
			<p>Perth then passed to a seemingly promising new Labor member in Tim Hammond, a barrister who had specialised in representing asbestos disease victims. Hammond increased the Labor margin at the 2016 election to 3.3% after a redistribution cut it from 4.4% to 2.2%. However, Hammond lasted only until May 2018, when he made the surprise announcement that he was leaving politics due to the strains it was placing on his family life. The ensuing by-election was easily won for Labor in the absence of a Liberal candidate by Patrick Gorman, who went on to pick up a 1.6% swing at the 2019 election.</p>

			<p>Perth's central business district lies in the south-western corner of the electorate that bears its name, which extends north to Yokine and east to Bassendean. The electorate is typical of a central city seat in having high incomes and a preponderance of residents in their twenties and thirties, although in lesser degree than such electorates in bigger cities.</p>
			<p>While the electorate existed in name from federation, it accounted for the entire metropolitan area together with Fremantle before assuming more familiar dimensions in 1949. The latest redistribution has added around 27% of the enrolment of abolished Stirling in a Liberal-leaning area including Tuart Hill, Yokine and southern Dianella, and transferred 15% of the old Perth's voters to Cowan, in an area north of Morley Drive including northern Morley and Noranda.</p>

		<background>
			<p>Marginal seat in Perth's inner south-east that will be vacated with the retirement of Steve Irons, who has ridden the Liberals' high tide in Western Australia to hold the seat since 2007. Irons' margin progressed from 0.1% in 2007 to a peak of 6.5% in 2013, before successive Labor swings reduced it to 2.7% in 2019. His opponent on that occasion was Hannah Beazley, daughter of Kim Beazley and now the member for the corresponding state seat of Victoria Park. The latest redistribution has added 0.5% to the Liberal margin through a gain of territory at the eastern end of the electorate.</p>
			<p>Swan has existed in name since federation, but it covered large areas of the South West region before the enlargement of parliament in 1949. It was held on its inauguration by Sir John Forrest, colonial Premier and federation founding father, and was in Labor hands for only two brief periods until 1969. Adrian Bennett then held it for Labor through to the 1975 landslide, when he was unseated by Liberal candidate John Martyr.</p>
			<p>The seat returned to Labor in 1980 with the election of Kim Beazley Jr, future party leader and son of Whitlam government minister Kim Beazley Sr. Beazley gained the seat with an 8.1% swing and added another 8.6% in 1983, before the enlargement of parliament in 1984 cut 4.1% from his margin by transferring inner eastern suburbs around Bassendean to Perth. After successive Liberal swings in 1990 and 1993 reduced his margin to 294 votes, Beazley moved to the somewhat safer seat of Brand in 1996, which he nonetheless retained by only 387 votes.</p>
			<p>Swan was won for the Liberals in Beazley's absence by Don Randall, who lasted only one term before Kim Wilkie recovered it for Labor in 1998. Randall would return in 2001 as the member for Canning, which he held until his death in 2015. Wilkie held Swan for three terms, though he barely survived Labor's poor performance across Perth in 2004, despite a disastrous campaign for Liberal candidate Andrew Murfin. A correction after the Liberals' under-performance in 2004 may explain the seat bucking the trend in 2007, when a 0.2% swing to Steve Irons was sufficient to account for Wilkie's fragile margin.</p>

			<p>Swan is bounded to the north by the Swan River and to the west and south by the Canning River, extending from riverside South Perth and Como in the west through Belmont and Cannington to High Wycombe and Forrestfield in the east, with much of the centre dominated by Perth Airport and the Kewdale and Welshpool light industrial areas. A distinction is evident between an affluent and Liberal-voting west and a lower-income, Labor-voting east, reflected in the corresponding state seats of South Perth and Victoria Park usually being safe for Liberal and Labor respectively.</p>
			<p>Swan covered the state's South West region until the creation of Forrest in 1922, when it was reoriented around the Avon Valley further north. It would not become entirely urban until the enlargement of parliament in 1949, when the rural territory was divided between the new seats of Moore and Canning. The latest redistribution has added Maida Vale, Forrestfield and Wattle Grove at the eastern end, which formerly constituted around 16% of the enrolment of Hasluck.</p>

Mascarenhas emerged as the sole contender after the Left-dominated administration committee blocked the nomination of the only other contender, former South Perth councillor Fiona Reid, on the grounds she had run as an independent at the 2017 state election, a decision that displeased the Right faction Shop Distributive and Allied Employees Association.</p>

			<p>Safe Liberal seat in southern Perth that has been held by Ben Morton since he deposed Dennis Jensen for preselection at the 2016 election, then went untroubled by Jensen's bid to retain the seat as an independent. Labor won the seat on its inauguration in 1974 and again in 1983, but ceased to be competitive after boundary changes in 1990.</p>
			<p>Labor's successful candidate in 1974 was John Dawkins, who was heavily defeated in the 1975 landslide and returned as member for Fremantle in 1977, later to serve as Treasurer under Paul Keating. Peter Shack then held Tangney for the Liberals until 1993, except for a term after his defeat in 1983 by George Gear, who moved to Canning in 1984. Shack had a forgettable stint as Shadow Health Minister before the 1990 election, and was imprisoned in 2013 for stealing from his former wife's family trust.</p>
			<p>Shack was succeeded by Daryl Williams, who served as Attorney-General from the election of the Howard government in 1996 to 2003, and then as Communications Minister until his retirement in 2004. The seat was then held by Dennis Jensen, a former defence analyst and CSIRO research scientist. Jensen suffered preselection defeats ahead of both the 2007 and 2010 elections, but was saved both times by intervention from the party organisation.</p>
			<p>Jensen's already tenuous position was further undermined when he lined up against Tony Abbott during Malcolm Turnbull's successful leadership challenge in September 2015, alienating conservative backers who had been impressed by his conservative positions on climate change, the stolen generations apology and same-sex marriage. He was subsequently defeated for preselection by Ben Morton, then the party's state director, and managed only 11.9% of the primary vote as an independent candidate.</p>

It had a very different complexion on its creation in 1974, covering a swathe of Perth's south-east from industrial Kwinana on the coast to Gosnells. The enlargement of parliament in 1984 made it a Liberal seat by transferring the former area to the new seat of Brand, which has been held by Labor ever since.</p>

			<p>Morton supported Peter Dutton when he challenged Malcolm Turnbull for the leadership in August 2018, but then became instrumental behind the emergence of Scott Morrison in the second round. He was one of the decisive final signatories to the petition calling for a second party room meeting, and served as one of Morrison's main organisers ahead of the second ballot. He was promoted to parliamentary secretary after the 2019 election and then to the outer ministry in October 2021, in the roles of Special Minister of State and Minister for the Public Service.</p>
